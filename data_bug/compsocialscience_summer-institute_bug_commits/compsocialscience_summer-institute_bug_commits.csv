I am also an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture–novelty, ambiguity, topology–of human understanding. He is especially interested in innovation–how new ideas and technologies emerge–and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of his work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but he is also interested in other domains of knowledge–news, law, religion, gossip, hunches and historical modes of thinking and knowing.

+    <p>His research combines LLM fine-tuning and agent-based modelling, while also maintaining several industry collaborations as an Al consultant, developing custom RAG systems and knowledge graph solutions. Outside academia, he contributes to data (and traditional) journalism projects at Scomodo magazine, applying machine learning methods to analyse political and social phenomena. His side projects include developing tools for polling data analysis, fine-tuning models for various purposes, and creating datasets for academic research. His approach involves bridging theoretical frameworks with practical applications, using computational methods to understand social dynamics while ensuring results are accessible and meaningful for both academic and public audiences.</p>

 In Week 2, students will commence group projects. Groups are encouraged to pursue whatever ideas they might find interesting, however, we provide some initial suggestions:
 
 - **Social Simulation:** Build an agent-based model (ABM) or game theoretic simulation to explore a toy democratic or social media system.  
 - **Philosophical Inquiry:** Unpack an interesting philosophical question, like an ethical dilemmas, relating to democracy and social media.  
-- **Data Work:** Pose research questions and analyse social media data to uncover trends, drawing from our in-house database (including all of Reddit, 4chan’s /pol/, Voat, Telegram, the .win network, HackerNews, Parler, and more).

 We strongly encourage the following qualities:
 - Think systemically: Address root causes, not symptoms (e.g., how recommender systems shape public discourse, not individual ""bad actors"").  
 - Embrace interdisciplinary approaches: Merge technical, philosophical, and social science perspectives.  
 - Challenge yourself in new ways: If you're not familiar with data science, try to learn and apply an advanced technique, or if you're a data scientist, push yourself to try do some philosophy.  
 
-Supervisors will be available to projects to  provide mentorship and tehcnical assistance for accessing our datasets and applying advanced techniques.

-  bio: ""Why are misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading at an unprecedented rate? 
-  What can citizens do to combat hate online? And how can we design social media platforms 
-  in such a way that they are conducive to civic discourse? These are questions that we want 
-  to answer in our research group. In the past, we have looked at what measures can most 
-  effectively prevent coronavirus outbreaks in schools, how resilient the Austrian healthcare 
-  system is to disruption, and how a changing understanding of \""honesty\"" 
-  can explain why politicians in the US are increasingly spreading misinformation. 
-
-  In our research, we rely on computational approaches: we use machine learning to identify
-  patterns in large amounts of data, statistical models help us to establish correlations 
-  between observations, and computer simulations allow us to run through various scenarios 
-  and make policy recommendations. To do this, we often use huge data sets of ""digital traces"", 
-  i.e. data such as posts or reactions on social media platforms that people leave behind 
-  when they use the internet.
-
-  In order to answer the important social questions of our time at the interface between 
-  society and technology, researchers from many different scientific disciplines must come 
-  together. That is why we are an interdisciplinary team with expertise ranging from computer 
-  science, sociology and psychology to physics. We welcome people with a technical background
-  who are interested in social issues as well as students and researchers from the humanities 
-  and social sciences who are enthusiastic about computational methods!.""

The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).
 
 The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, with a special emphasis on causal inference. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include causal inference with observational data, text analysis, network analysis, survey experiments, and machine learning. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
 
-Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially junior faculty from neighboring institutions near Pozna_, Poland. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 8-day program, but we are open to alternative arrangements for faculty members.

-We have received an exceptionally high number of applications compared to previous editions. There were around 50 applications for 15 places. Our selection process was guided based on three criteria: a CV, a statement of interest, and a writing sample. Moreover, we have considered the career stage, field of study, and familiarity with methods to assemble a balanced group. Three organisers thoroughly reviewed all applications and decided on the 15 highest-ranking individuals.

-Creating a rank list of students allowed us to create a waiting list to invite more students in case accepted applicants jump off. Indeed, this happened in two cases, and since we already knew who to invite next, we did not lose any seats despite receiving this notice relatively late.

-Due to the great interest in the Summer Institute, we have decided to offer people who were not accepted to attend the activities during the complete first week online as well as the keynote speakers in the second week. As our Summer Institute was mostly organised hybrid already, offering this option didn’t require additional preparation or costs. While many people initially expressed interest in taking up this opportunity, we ended up with approximately five people who joined consistently during the Summer Institute. However, they were extremely positive about the possibility of online participation and their learning curve. This makes us optimistic about offering this option on future occasions.

-Pre-arrival and onboarding
-Upon arrival, we strongly suggested that accepted participants complete the SICSS boot camp. Moreover, we have created a syllabus that aligns with the schedule to enable students to prepare for the Summer Institute. We have shared this relatively early to put students in the position to prepare themselves. As the first week was held online, we have further attempted to clarify the technical requirements for joining remotely early. Slack has proved difficult here as every student can join easily, but only after repeated technical assistance. We have shared the “SICSS On-boarding Form” to add students to the network. Lastly, we asked students to indicate their dietary requirements for social dinner and coffee breaks.

-We have received a few questions from students during this period. Most of them asked where the Summer Institute takes place and where best to book accommodation. Therefore, in the future, it might be helpful to send students an information package providing them with the location of the department and suggestions for accommodation. Originally, we shared a map of Bologna with some additional information relatively shortly before the start.

-The first week took place on June 11 until June 14. These four days online were designed to bring students the same level of methodological knowledge of the basic toolbox of computational science and to familiarise them with current debates in the field. Knowing that it is generally difficult to convey a lot of content online, we have kept the days relatively short.  Each day, there was a workshop that taught methods and a presentation by scholars introducing larger conceptual issues.

-On three out of four days, we offered optional assignments, which allowed students to exercise the methods taught in the workshops at home. The idea was not to make this mandatory because not everyone would have time to submit them. The tasks were kept relatively simple to give less experienced students, in particular, the opportunity to improve before the group work in the second week of the summer institute. Additionally, we offered online office hours in the afternoon where students could consult us on the assignments or the material discussed in the Summer Institute. While few students completed the assignments, none attended the online office hours.

-A fundamental question that had to be weighed up here was whether students should work on their individual research questions (such as their doctoral thesis or master's thesis) or in groups during the second week. We decided in favour of the latter because it was our impression from previous versions of SICSS that the learning dynamic would otherwise be too individual. Group work allows students to participate equally in the content of the Summer Institute.

-To facilitate the group work to take place in the second week, we have already created the groups based on students' level of experience to create balanced groups. Thus, the first week concluded with creating break-out groups where the groups could already get to know each other and agree upon a topic before arriving in Bologna. This also allowed students to communicate with each other if they had arrived earlier.

-The second week took place between June 17 and 21. Before the start of the Summer Institute, we created name tags and a welcome package (notepad, jersey/t-shirt, etc.), which we allocated to each student at the beginning of the first week. The second week was designed according to the same principle: a keynote speech in the morning, introducing a ‘bigger’ theme of CSS, and group work in the afternoon. Where it was possible, keynote speakers stayed throughout the afternoon to answer questions and help students with their projects.

-This format has turned out very favourably. As most of the presenters spent the whole day with us (some even over two days), there was a very friendly atmosphere between organisers, presenters and participants, which characterised the atmosphere of the whole Summer Institute. This has contributed to a productive learning environment where individual needs were addressed.

-Students could work in the department until 6 pm and consult the organisers for any questions. However, overall, participants were rather shy about consulting us for questions. In the future, it might thus be helpful to organise a mandatory office hour/meeting with students in the middle of the week to encourage them to take stock of the advancements of their group project.

-A more specific problem was that students asked for more computing power for their project. This has made us aware that we should define a limit to the group work to be achieved during the week. Certainly, for various reasons, it is not necessary to come up with a computationally intensive project; rather, it is necessary to present an outcome that tests the research question on a smaller sample of the data. This should be emphasised more clearly in the future.

-The Summer Institute concluded with the presentation of the group projects on the last day. We have invited faculty members to attend students’ presentations so that participants receive valuable feedback on their work. Looking at the varying quality of the presentations, the question of whether students should work on individual projects or groups re-emerged. In view of the different progress made by the groups, it was difficult overall to provide substantial feedback at the presentations.

This has been particularly useful for students who asked for funding from their institutes, which requires them to provide formal proof of participation. Thus, we have created a template for future occasions.

-We received a lot of extremely positive feedback from the participants. From our point of view, the most pleasing feedback was that both participants with less experience and advanced participants expressed that they found the event useful. As the imbalance between advanced and less advanced students could have aggravated the learning process, we feel vindicated in the design of the programme and the selection of participants.

-Furthermore, it was interesting for future events that students explicitly stated that they prefer the format with group work to the format with their individual projects. In this respect, we were very pleased to hear that one group has even started to turn the SICSS project into a publication.

-We have thought about creating a survey that specifically asks about the experience in order to improve the programme in the future with this feedback. However, we felt students already received a lot of emails during the two weeks of the Summer Institute. Therefore, we decided that limiting ourselves to considering the feedback received in face-to-face conversations would be more beneficial.

-The instructional program will involve group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. Topics covered include machine learning, network analysis and digital experiments as well as ethics, validity and role of theory. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organisers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

 # Pre-arrival
 
-The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021.
+Two weeks is fairly intensive period to learn new topics.
+Therefore, we use a flipped classroom design to make most of our time together.
+Please read Chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 from “[Computational Thinking and Social Science](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/computational-thinking-and-social-science/book268542).”
 
-- Complete the pre-read
-- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed)
-- Watch lecture videos
-- Prepare your computing environment
+# If you are not familiar with programming
 
-TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.
+* Please read also Chapters 2, 5, and 8 before from the book.
+* In addition, you may use [SICSS online assets](https://sicss.io/overview) to help you in learning.
+* Do about 20 introductory Python/R programming exercises from each chapters
 
-## Reading
+# If you are not familiar with social sciences
 
-In order to prepare for SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should read Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.
-
-## Coding Boot Camp
-
-The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.
-
-If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
-- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
-- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
-- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
-- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.
-
-Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will employ R. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support those languages.
-
-## Lecture videos
-
-SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom).  Therefore, you should watch [videos of lectures](https://sicss.io/curriculum) before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities.
-
-## Computing environment
-
-### R
-
-Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
-
-### Zoom
-
-SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 is a virtual event, and we will use Zoom. You can join Zoom meetings using a phone or computer with a microphone and (ideally) a webcam. This [article](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/professional-video-call-from-home/) contains some helpful advice on how to set up your device and space to improve your Zoom experience. (Note: though the article recommends external microphones and webcams, we DO NOT recommend or require that you purchase any equipment to participate in SICSS. In our experience, the microphones and webcams built into most modern laptops and phones are perfectly sufficient).
-
-### Slack
-
-Before participating at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should have an account in the SICSS 2021 Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.
-
-### GitHub
-
-Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
-
-## Office hours
-
-The SICSS-Princeton [TAs](https://sicss.io/2021/princeton/people#teaching_assistants) will host weekly office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack. You can find information about the office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack channel #pre-office-hours. If you are not able to attend during the regularly scheduled office hours or have any questions about office hours, please contact one of the [TAs](https://sicss.io/2021/princeton/people#teaching_assistants).
+* Please read Chapter 12 from the book.
+* Please read the original papers from four deconstructed case studies.

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).
 
 The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
 
 Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. master students, and computational social scientists working on NGOs and industry. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20-30 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

+
+## Eligibility
+
+Participation is restricted to \_\_\_\_\_. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About \_\_\_\_\_ participants will be invited.
+
+The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
+
+We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
+
+## How To Apply
+
+Applicants must submit the following documents: \_\_\_\_\_
+
+**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by \_\_\_\_\_.** All application materials must be submitted through \_\_\_\_\_. Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by \_\_\_\_\_, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.
+
+Inquiries can be sent to \_\_\_\_\_.
+
+## Application Frequently Asked Questions
+
+#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?
+
+Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.
+
+#### Can I participate in SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?
+
+No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.

+# Pre-arrival
+
+The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021.
+
+- Complete the pre-read
+- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed)
+- Watch lecture videos
+- Prepare your computing environment
+
+TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.
+
+## Reading
+
+In order to prepare for SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should read Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.
+
+## Coding Boot Camp
+
+The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.
+
+If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
+- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
+- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
+- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
+- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.
+
+Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will employ R. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support those languages.
+
+## Lecture videos
+
+SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom).  Therefore, you should watch [videos of lectures](https://sicss.io/curriculum) before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities.
+
+## Computing environment
+
+### R
+
+Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
+
+### Zoom
+
+SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 is a virtual event, and we will use Zoom. You can join Zoom meetings using a phone or computer with a microphone and (ideally) a webcam. This [article](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/professional-video-call-from-home/) contains some helpful advice on how to set up your device and space to improve your Zoom experience. (Note: though the article recommends external microphones and webcams, we DO NOT recommend or require that you purchase any equipment to participate in SICSS. In our experience, the microphones and webcams built into most modern laptops and phones are perfectly sufficient).
+
+### Slack
+
+Before participating at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should have an account in the SICSS 2021 Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.
+
+### GitHub
+
+Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
+
+## Office hours
+
+The SICSS-Princeton [TAs](https://sicss.io/2021/princeton/people#teaching_assistants) will host weekly office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack. You can find information about the office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack channel #pre-office-hours. If you are not able to attend during the regularly scheduled office hours or have any questions about office hours, please contact one of the [TAs](https://sicss.io/2021/princeton/people#teaching_assistants).

+
+## Eligibility
+
+Participation is restricted to \_\_\_\_\_. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About \_\_\_\_\_ participants will be invited.
+
+The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
+
+We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
+
+## How To Apply
+
+Applicants must submit the following documents: \_\_\_\_\_
+
+**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by \_\_\_\_\_.** All application materials must be submitted through \_\_\_\_\_. Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by \_\_\_\_\_, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.
+
+Inquiries can be sent to \_\_\_\_\_.
+
+## Application Frequently Asked Questions
+
+#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?
+
+Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.
+
+#### Can I participate in SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?
+
+No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.

+From June 13 to June 28, 2024, \_\_\_\_\_ will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually at \_\_\_\_\_. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).
+
+The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
+
+Participation is restricted to \_\_\_\_\_. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About \_\_\_\_\_ participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

+# Pre-arrival
+
+The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021.
+
+- Complete the pre-read
+- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed)
+- Watch lecture videos
+- Prepare your computing environment
+
+TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.
+
+## Reading
+
+In order to prepare for SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should read Matt Salganik’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.
+
+## Coding Boot Camp
+
+The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.
+
+If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
+- [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
+- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
+- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
+- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.
+
+Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will employ R. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support those languages.
+
+## Lecture videos
+
+SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom).  Therefore, you should watch [videos of lectures](https://sicss.io/curriculum) before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities.
+
+## Computing environment
+
+### R
+
+Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
+
+### Zoom
+
+SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021 is a virtual event, and we will use Zoom. You can join Zoom meetings using a phone or computer with a microphone and (ideally) a webcam. This [article](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/professional-video-call-from-home/) contains some helpful advice on how to set up your device and space to improve your Zoom experience. (Note: though the article recommends external microphones and webcams, we DO NOT recommend or require that you purchase any equipment to participate in SICSS. In our experience, the microphones and webcams built into most modern laptops and phones are perfectly sufficient).
+
+### Slack
+
+Before participating at SICSS-\_\_\_\_\_ 2021, you should have an account in the SICSS 2021 Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.
+
+### GitHub
+
+Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
+
+## Office hours
+
+The SICSS-Princeton [TAs](https://sicss.io/2021/princeton/people#teaching_assistants) will host weekly office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack. You can find information about the office hours in the SICSS 2021 Slack channel #pre-office-hours.

   bio: ""I am a Ph.D. student in legal sciences at the University of Pisa. My fields of research are administrative law, economic public law, and legal technology. My research project focuses on the use of law and technology instruments by public administrations. More in details, I study the possible use and legal issues of existing computational technologies, based mostly on machine learning algorithms, to help public officers in the interpretation of texts of law and the management of administrative procedures. I graduated in law at the University of Milan in 2012. In 2015, I was admitted to the Milan Bar Association and actively practiced law before starting my Ph.D. program, in 2021. I am also collaborating with the Polytechnic University of Milan in administrative, public procurement and data protection law courses.

 The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include network analysis, machine learning, benchmarking, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

 We accepted with gratitude the feedback from participants who kept saying that there were two best things about the Institute: people (open-minded, enthusiastic and cooperative) and the possibility to grow (learning new research methods, and programming). We note that this was possible not only thanks to the support and funding from various institutions and thanks to highly-involved participants. We believe that this was achieved also by a committed group of organizers who looked out for each other and worked as one team, often beyond “working hours”.

 ### Programme design
 
-To design the program, we relied on the experiences of our two main organizers (Jana Lasser and Ivan Smirnov), who had either already organized a SICSS location (Ivan, HSE, 2021) or participated in one (Jana, Helsinki, 2021). We designed the programme alongside our strengths and research interests as computational social scientists and invited external speakers to bring diversity and fill in gaps. This included lectures offering a critical perspective on the state of the field of CSS, publishing CSS research and common pitfalls in CSS research projects as well as hands-on lectures on how to use APIs to collect data, how to run large-scale surveys on Amazon Mechanical turk and how to leverage large language models for CSS research. These lectures were complemented by two lectures by our senior organizers: an introduction to networks for CSS research from Markus Strohmaier and a lecture on how to combine large-scale surveys with digital trace data by David Garcia. We were also fortunate to welcome Suhem Parack to give us an introduction to using the Twitter API v2 to collect data for CSS research. Since both main organizers mainly work with Python, we decided to commit to teaching our SICSS location completely in Python, aiming to contribute teaching materials in Python to the collection of teaching materials of SICSS.

-**Venue**
+#### Venue
+
 Our SICSS location was funded by a funding programme of TU Graz, dedicated to fund online teaching activities that are collaboratively hosted by two universities - in our case RWTH Aachen and TU Graz. We, therefore, planned our programme to take place completely online. We designed the outline of our programme similar to other SICSS locations, planning for one week of lectures and hands-on exercises, followed by one week of group project work with talks by guest lecturers in the evenings to have a common event every day.
 
 ### Before the summer school
 
-**Outreach**
+#### Outreach 
+
 We specifically advertised our SICSS location within our two host universities TU Graz and RWTH Aachen, since we wanted to attract students from the Computational Social Systems master’s programme at both universities. We, therefore, advertised the summer school in short pitches in relevant lectures during the winter semester and through mailing lists of lecturers and students of the master’s programme. In addition, we advertised our location over social media channels (Twitter and LinkedIn) as well as over the main SICSS website.
 
-**Applications**
+#### Applications
+
 We attracted a total of 71 applications. Students had to submit an academic CV and a motivation letter (1 page), describing their motivation to participate in our SICSS location and the potential benefit for their study and research career. We required no prior programming skills and no specific disciplinary background to apply. Students needed to have at least a bachelor’s degree to apply to our location. We also decided not to ask for recommendation letters. We believe that recommendation letters impose a disproportionate burden on students while there is little evidence of their usefulness.
 
 We aimed to admit 40 students, with guaranteed spots for students from TU and KFU Graz and RWTH Aachen in case they meet the minimum requirements and submit a complete application. We received a total of 5 applications from TU Graz and 3 from RWTH Aachen. The rest of the applications came from students enrolled at other universities. We also received a number of applications from PostDocs or people that had left academia. Given the choice of admitting a student or a non-student with similarly strong application materials, we decided to admit the student, since we felt they would benefit more from our summer school. We also paid special attention to applicants from groups that are underrepresented in CSS.
 
 We invited a total of 40 students to participate in our SICSS location. The disciplinary backgrounds of the people admitted to our location were very diverse, including students from political science (7), computer science (6), social science (5), psychology (5), computational social science (4), economics (3), collective intelligence (2) and physics, statistics, linguistics, data science, geography, engineering, journalism, and genders studies (1 student each). Similarly, the country of residence of our students was very diverse, with the rather high prevalence of German (8) and Austrian (5) students reflecting our increased outreach efforts in these countries, followed by the US (5), Morocco (3), UK (2), Russia (2) and Italy, South Africa, China, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Argentina, Turkey, Korea, Belgium, France, Serbia, Greece and Iran (1 student each). Gender identities were almost balanced, with 22 participants identifying as male, 17 as female, and 1 as non-binary. Rejection rates were similarly balanced, with 52% of the rejected participants identifying as male, 45% as female, and 3% as neither.
 
-**Python crash course**
-We did not require any previous (Python) programming knowledge to enroll in our summer school. To get everybody up-to-speed regarding programming in Python, we offered a voluntary two-week Python crash course in the month before our summer school. The course consisted of a curated collection of online learning materials, tailored to fit the needs of participants in our summer school with introductions to general programming in Python (first week) and introductions to the libraries pandas, networkx, statsmodels and matplotlib in the second week. The Python crash course was supervised by two of our teaching assistants, Moritz Erlacher and Florian Hofer, who contributed a great deal of experience in teaching beginner-level programming courses in Python. Since we were aware that our participants had other study or work commitments in the month leading up to the summer school, we designed the Python crash course to be mainly self-paced learning with videos and exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. We offered office hours in the early mornings and late afternoons to help with questions regarding the exercises. The crash course was greatly appreciated by our participants and helped to equilibrate the level of programming skills across our participants at least a bit.

We provided a guide on how to apply for academic access within the scope of our summer school, which was greatly appreciated by students. A total of 33 students applied for academic access and 6 of these applications were denied for unknown reasons.

 ### During the summer school
 
-**Instruction week**
+#### Instruction week 
+
 During the instruction week, we usually started with one lecture of 60-90 minutes at 9:30, followed by one hands-on exercise or group discussion for 90-120 minutes. We made sure to provide breaks of 10 minutes every 45-60 minutes since student feedback indicated that in the online setting it was often not easy to follow instructions for extended blocks of time. After a lunch break of 60 minutes, we had another lecture of 60-90 minutes, followed by a hands-on exercise of 90 minutes and a group discussion of 15-20 minutes to wrap up the day. We asked students for feedback every day, asking them “what did you like about today’s sessions” and “what could be improved”? We received very helpful comments and ideas on how to improve online collaboration from the students, which we tried to implement on the following day. Students indicated that they greatly appreciated that their feedback was promptly incorporated into our location’s organization. We also received a lot of very positive feedback, which was very uplifting to read when preparing the sessions for the next day.
 
 On Friday afternoon we hosted a brainstorming session of 2x60 minutes in random groups of four students each to generate project ideas. Students had to provide an idea title, short description, and responsible person for follow-up questions. This generated a total of 34 ideas. Students could then indicate their interest in working on one of these projects, with the aim of forming project groups of 3-4 students each for the project work in the following week.
 
-**Project week**
+#### Project week 
+
 We matched people into groups over the weekend between the instruction and project week and students could start working on their projects on Monday morning. We asked them to self-organize their working schedule during the project week, indicating that we expected approximately 5 hours of project work every day. The matching resulted in a total of 10 project groups. We split the supervision of the project groups between the two main lecturers such that each lecturer was responsible for supervising 5 groups. We asked groups to have daily check-ins of ~20 minutes every day. During these check-ins we met the groups in a video chat and helped them with a clearer definition of their research objectives and methods as well as methodological issues. In addition to the daily supervision check-ins, we provided programming support by teaching assistants, who offered office hours in the mornings and afternoons to help with programming questions. Projects were presented on the last day of the summer school. Every group had 10 minutes to present what they worked on plus five minutes of questions.

 ### Logistics
 
-**Finances**
+#### Finances 
+
 We received a grant of 15,000€ from TU Graz to organize a “joint online course”. We used this money to hire four student assistants to help with the python programming crash course, python programming support during the summer school, and the organization of social activities. In addition, we paid honoraria of 500€ per lecture to our external speakers from these funds. Since our location was run completely online, we did not need funds for student accommodation or food. Initially, we wanted to compensate our two main organizers for their efforts as well, but this was not possible with these funds.
 
-**Communication**
+#### Communication 
 Our main communication channel during the summer school was the SICSS Slack platform. There, we created one main channel for our location, and two additional channels, one for programming support and one to collect links to useful information. In addition, we sent all important information and reminders for lectures by invited speakers over email.

-**Social aspects of online learning & interaction**
 Our course was organized completely online to accommodate students from different locations. While this was very useful to attract many students from different locations it also resulted in some challenges regarding teaching and social interaction. We noticed early on in the daily student feedback that students needed many breaks to be able to follow lectures in an online setting for an extended period of time. We ended up introducing 10 minutes breaks every 30-40 minutes to help students withstand the “zoom fatigue”.
 
 We tried to offer a number of social activities around the core course activities. We noticed that participation in these activities was very low. This can probably be attributed to the fact that social activities were also purely online. Students were just exhausted after 6+ hours of online instruction every day and spending another 1-2 hours in front of a screen – even for social activities – was not very appealing to them. As for learning, since we think the social and networking aspects of the summer school are very important, we will probably integrate the social activities better into the course itself the next time we run it, at the expense of lectures and exercises.

 Lastly, hands-on exercises and group projects involved a lot of programming. Providing students with programming help where needed was challenging in the online setting. Sharing screens and typing commands in a chat works to some extent, but it would be much easier to help students if lecturers could interact with them in an offline setting and help them on their laptops rather than through video chat.
 
-**JSON**
+#### JSON
+
 Many APIs return JSON as a response format. To be able to easily work with the data, it first needs to be converted to a tabular format. While we taught students about how to handle pandas data frames in the Python crash course, we did not properly teach them how to handle data in JSON format and how to convert JSON to data frames. This created a number of problems and delays when students had to work on their projects and a lot of demand for programming support during the project week. A learning from this is to provide a dedicated tutorial on how to handle data in JSON format in the future, and/or to provide dedicated functions that convert JSON to well-formatted CSV files for a number of APIs.
 
-**Group projects**
+#### Group projects
+
 One surprising observation was the homogeneity of group projects by our participants. All of them used Twitter as the main source of data. All of them applied sentiment analysis as the main or secondary method for analyzing data. Almost all of the projects were related to politics. This was despite our efforts to show during the lecture week how broad the CSS field could be and despite the fact that many other APIs were introduced. However, the Twitter API was in the focus of some of our lectures and exercises and it seems that using it was the easiest option for our participants.
 
 It could be that using the most familiar API was the only way to ensure that participants would be able to get some results given the time constraints of a project week. On the other hand, we feel that we didn’t pay enough attention to teaching participants how to choose a good research question and how to choose data sources/methods that would be the most appropriate to answer this question. Some participants mentioned that coming from a computational background they would like to learn more about social science, to learn how to choose a question, etc. Given the time constraints of a project week, we think the only solution would be to introduce a “proposal track” for projects in addition to a “practical track”. Creating a good research proposal would require work on selecting a good research question, exploring the relevant literature, thinking about the best data source and methods. However, properly done, these activities would easily consume the whole project week and that wouldn’t allow participants to try to get some data and perform preliminary analysis. We are not sure what would be the best compromise between providing a practical experience and devoting more time to general research competencies.
 
-**Final remarks**
+### Final remarks
 We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback after the school with participants emphasizing not only the quality of our content but also the special atmosphere of the school. We are not sure how to reproduce this because we don’t feel that we have done anything special and we are surprised by the positivity of feedback ourselves. However, we think that the fact that the school was run by two postdocs (not professors) might have contributed to that. This significantly reduced the distance between participants and lecturers and allowed us to openly talk about academic life, share our struggles, and critique the status quo. This openness seems to help to create a ""we"" feeling at the end of the school — as one participant put it in their feedback.

+#### Funding
+
 SICSS ATL received $6,000 from the main site and over $10,000 from GSU. Money was spent in four key areas: TA stipend, meals, Prolific survey costs, and group project funding.
 
 The budget request from the main site was originally closer to 12k, but I limited it severely at their request, and I do have some personal regrets about doing so. I did not take an honorarium for organizing the institute and did end up spending nearly 2 thousand dollars of my own money on flights/daily transportation to fully engage with the institute. In the past, the organizer honorarium defrayed these expenses. It was particularly difficult for me to do this as a first-year faculty member who was new to 9-month contracts. I did so because I was worried that we wouldn’t get funding for the institute at all but was a little disappointed to hear that honorarium were still given to some sites but not others. Next year, I will request honoraria because 2 of the co-organizers are PhD students, and I would not ask them to give their time without any compensation.

 Cynthia and I met weekly from December through the summer institute, making sure all the logistical pieces were in place. Cynthia was enormously helpful during this process, since she had ready access to university listservs, knowledge of the campus and its vendors, and had more connections with area faculty than I did.
 
 We largely followed the procedures I previously used to organize SICSS Chicago for a number of years to good effect. We created a Gmail account for SICSS ATL communications, with the intention of being able to hand it off to any Atlanta-area institution that may wish to rotate in teaching SICSS.
 
-**Selection Process**
+#### Selection Process
+
 We opted for a high-effort application process to avoid attrition. We asked that participants give a research statement, a CV, a writing sample, and asked graduate students to provide contact information for a reference. We received 40 applications that we considered complete and plausible. We selected around 23 of these applications and with attrition had 20 participants complete the workshop (1 was no longer able to attend due to injury, 1 was not comfortable participating at the institute due to Covid-19, and 1had their partner test positive for Covid-19 during the institute and could not complete it). Participant recruitment focused on Atlanta area schools broadly construed, but participants came from Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, University of Massachusetts Boston, University of North Carolina Charlotte, the Georgia Policy Lab, University of Georgia, Yale University, University of Berkeley California, Mercer University, and Emory University. Participants were a healthy mix of professors, postdocs, and advanced graduate students.

 We offered the usual suite of pre-arrival materials for the institute. There was evidence that many of the participants did read Bit-by-Bit as requested, but participants generally did not make use of TA office hours or use the coding tutorials extensively before the institute. Consistent with previous years, 1-3 participants contacted the teaching assistant, Olga Churkina, for help before the institute. However, participants did use the materials provided on the SICSS website during the institute, often mentioning reviewing them the night before a new topic or using them while working on their group projects.

An online-only summer school is not the best option, as digital fatigue quickly sets in and there is a risk of participants dropping out. A hybrid approach not only helps reduce costs but it also allows for a more flexible approach to summer school design. The three-week period may have been long and challenging overall, but for this beginner group, it proved fruitful. It may be possible to change the approach to one week online and two weeks face-to-face to avoid the difficulties of week two, even if it increases the cost.

 Based on the exit survey, we knew that the SICSS-Korea was quite successful in multiple quantitative and qualitative measures. 12 out of 18 participants filled out the exit survey. Regarding the question on the program's quality, 75% of the participants said they are “VERY POSITIVE” in recommending the SICSS-Korea to other colleagues and friends. One participant commented that they learned from the SICSS-Korea “Many things. Each lecture and guest talk was eye-opening, and group practices and group projects taught me the practical difficulties and concerns that are difficult to learn from textbooks. I really learned a lot from informal conversations with the organizers and participants as well!” The same participant also commented that “ (1) I want to write a paper using one of the methods I learned through SICSS by learning more about it. (2) In the near future, I hope to learn more to be confident and knowledgeable enough to offer an introductory course on computational social science at my home institute.” Another participant expressed a similar enthusiasm: “I would pursue to grow to be a part of css fields and follow up-to-date fast-changing trends of computational methods.” All in all, the SICSS-Korea inspired a new generation of computational social scientists in and outside Korea and a strong network among them that could last even after the SICSS-Korea is over. We believe that our participants and their experience with the SICSS-Korea are the most valuable impact produced by the program.

Meanwhile, we have prepared for the participation certificate signed by both organizers. In Europe, many universities may need the proof to cover the expenses. As this is the first year of on-site program, we find that having such a program at a nice location would be more useful than virtual format, because the face-to-face communication would be a key component of the program as well. In the next year, we hope we could keep promoting the SICSS in Iberia to have more participants and a growing CSS community.

 After SICSS was over, we followed up with the students who submitted grant applications. We funded most of the projects - basically anyone who proposed something that came out of the camp itself, rather than asking for funding for the normal work they were doing before the camp. The students set up a WhatsApp group to stay in touch (tbh, the slack channel was not as active as we would have liked during the sessions, and basically went dormant after our last day together). We were swag-less, sadly. But I think the connections will outlast any mug. We will keep checking in periodically as we plan for next year (including looking for new organisers) and hopefully encourage more alumni connections if SICSS-London 2023 actually happens.

Think about how you will handle a situation where the catering does not arrive or does not accommodate a particular request.
 * __When possible, request funding for praticipant travel/boarding costs:__ An exciting aspect of SICSS is the opportunity for participants to meet with others outside of their subfield, discipline, or university. One way to make this possible is to provide for the travel and boarding arrangements of those coming to the institute from out of town. While there are no tuition or registration fees for SICSS by design, when possible, providing some amount of additional funding for participants can help make the event even more inclusive.

 We are proud to announce that we will once again be able to provide financial support to those who wish to host partner locations thanks to the generous support of the funders described below. As in past years, our resources are limited — as much as we would love to fully fund every organizing team who submits an application to run a SICSS partner location, we will likely be unable to do so. Therefore, we encourage organizers who have capacity and means to do so to look into self-sponsoring their location via their own universities or organizations, or through developing partnerships with non-profit organizations or corporations.
 
-Applications selected for financial support will receive \$15,000 to support the cost of the institute — \$7,200 for honoraria (to be split between organizers and TAs); \$1,800 to support the cost of food and room rental fees; and \$5,000 to fund participant research projects. In 2023, we intend to fully fund six SICSS partner locations at this amount. If you require less funding than this amount (perhaps you are running a location that is only a week long, or are receiving funding from alternate sources), please indicate so on the application.

 ## When to use dictionary-based approaches?
 
 - quality of dictionary-based methods depends heavily upon the match between learning-corpus and corpus of interest
 - creating your own dictionaries might often be the best option, but is time sensitive
 - if you are looking for specific things rather than for categorizing documents, dictionary methods often perform better than more sophisticated techniques (e.g. topic modeling)

I have attended a classical high school, focusing on humanities courses like Philosophy, Latin, and Ancient Greek. By studying Economics and Statistics, I developed a fascination for applied economic research. I became interested in learning more about decision-making processes and how economics influences them, also considering ethical and psychological implications.  In the future, I would like to pursue a Master’s Degree in Behavioral Economics, with a specific focus on the role played by this field in evidence-based policymaking. In addition, I am presently volunteering as a marketing team leader in Aiesec in Roma Tor Vergata, which has helped me build my leadership abilities and boost soft skills such as public speaking, problem-solving, time management, and teamwork.""

-- bio: My name is Ariana Alexandra Stefania Mrejeru and I’m 21 years old. Currently I’m a student enrolled in Global Governance B.A. at university of Tor Vergata in Rome. One of my biggest passions is investigating my surroundings and understanding the reasons and the factors influencing specific situations. I value awareness and I think multidisciplinarity is the best way to achieve it. As said before, I’m still a student and so I’m still projecting my future day by day. Now I’m not able to clearly say what I want to do one day, but I can definitely answer what kind of person I want to be in the next few years. I would like to help people, working on society's dynamics. Although I'm still not sure how to do it, I strongly believe in cooperation and awareness as the means to achieve freedom.

-- bio: My name is Cecilia and I live in Rome, Italy. I consider myself a curious, determined and dynamic woman involved in being an active part in this modern, digital and globalized society. I believe that there are no limits when we talk about knowledge and skills that someone can acquire and that is exactly my goal for the future: never stop learning. By striving for excellence through active leadership, my objectives are to empower others and become a world citizen. Having attended a scientific high school and being part of a multidisciplinary Bachelor (Global Governance) helped me to master many topics from the more philosophical to the more mathematical ones, and I believe that this program would advantage me in the process of upgrading my skills and comprehension not only on the topic to be discussed but also on the field of Behavioral Economics, which I would love to master during my future career.

 - name: Eric Shuman 
   bio: I recently completed my PhD student in social psychology at the University of Groningen supervised by Eran Halperin, Tamar Saguy, and Martijn van Zomeren, and am about to begin my post-doc at NYU with Eric Knowles and Harvard University with Amit Goldenberg. My research interests include collective action, emotions, and intergroup power relations. In particular, I am interested in different types of collective action (e.g. nonviolent, nonnormative, violent). My research examines psychological factors that promote support for these types of action, but also the effects and effectiveness of these types of action at motivating historically advantaged groups to address inequality. I study the predictors and effects of collective action both using traditional psychological lab and survey experiments, but also by examining the dynamics and reactions to real-world protests in surveys and on social media.

   bio: I’m a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Finance of Bocconi University. I hold a PhD in Statistics, with a minor in behavioural science, from the University of Warwick. My research interests are focused on the behaviour of economic agents. They span several fields. First, I do research in behavioural finance. My works investigate the behaviour of individual financial traders and the disposition effect. Second, I work on different aspects of judgement and decision making: i) how patience interacts with age and economic conditions; ii) ambiguity attitudes towards financial products and how they relate to financial literacy; iii) how memory affects probability judgments of unexpected shocks, like Covid. Third, I work in the field of socio-economics. More specifically, on happiness economics, and on deception in economic interactions. I work with observational, survey, and experimental data. I employ a mix of techniques from survival analysis, causal inference, and machine learning.

-- bio: I am an Italian student in “Global Governance” at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata.” I have always been interested in social sciences. One of my main purposes has always been to understand how the world works. Before studying statistics, I used to think that numbers were mainly related to natural sciences only, but this subject showed me the importance of quantitative methods in social sciences as well. Furthermore, as an intern in an NGO, I discovered the importance of data to assess the quality and the impact of all those kinds of third sector programs aimed at improving the well-being of people. Thus, these “discoveries” made me think about a future career in the field of public policy and economics. For all these reasons, I decided to join the SICSS in Rome. Learning a new programming language and discovering a new and truly interdisciplinary subject, such as computational social science, will be highly beneficial for my academic and professional future. Last but not least, I can’t look forward to being part of such a heterogeneous class and meeting new people from all over the world!

I have attended a scientific high school, acquiring a preparation both on quantitative methods but also on the humanistic perspective, and starting to be interested in social sciences. During my bachelor degree, I had the opportunity of attending courses regarding different fields of study: in particular, I started to be interested about economics, with a special focus on the behavioural approach to the discipline and thus on the research on the decision making process of the individual in different contexts and conditions, which I intend to deepen in my future studies. During my undergraduate degree I also have the chance of deepening my knowledge in other fields of research such as statistics and philosophy, which are often the subjects of the books that I read and that I alternate with novels. Aside from reading, another interest that I have developed is writing.

-The videos associated with Day 2 of SICSS 2021 covered a broad range of topics including screen-scraping, working with APIs, and building apps and bots for social science research. Some of you have already had experience with some these issues-- but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This group exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) and cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to social science theory as well (and thus motivate possible group research projects during the second week of SICSS).

-1) Within your randomly assigned groups, work together (on Zoom) to identify a research question that you believe can be answered using digital trace data. You will not have time to answer this question in full today, but the conversation you have today could eventually lead to a group project during the second week of SICSS. It is equally-- or even more likely- it may not. One of the reasons this step is so open-ended is that we want to encourage you to get to know each other, learn from each other, and practice asking questions together.

 3) Identify a sampling frame to help you answer this research question. For example, if your question is about politics, your sampling frame might be a list of elected officials on Twitter;
 4) Use legal screen-scraping techniques in order to collect the names of individual accounts, keywords, or topic areas to populate your sample.
 5) Write code to collect data from each unit of analysis in your sample (e.g. tweets of elected officials)"

+title: ""SICSS Group Exercise Day 2""
+output: html_document
+---
+
+The videos associated with Day 2 of SICSS 2021 covered a broad range of topics including screen-scraping, working with APIs, and building apps and bots for social science research. Some of you have already had experience with some these issues-- but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This group exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) and cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to social science theory as well (and thus motivate possible group research projects during the second week of SICSS).
+
+1) Within your randomly assigned groups, work together (on Zoom) to identify a research question that you believe can be answered using digital trace data. You will not have time to answer this question in full today, but the conversation you have today could eventually lead to a group project during the second week of SICSS. It is equally-- or even more likely- it may not. One of the reasons this step is so open-ended is that we want to encourage you to get to know each other, learn from each other, and practice asking questions together.
+3) Identify a sampling frame to help you answer this research question. For example, if your question is about politics, your sampling frame might be a list of elected officials on Twitter;
+4) Use legal screen-scraping techniques in order to collect the names of individual accounts, keywords, or topic areas to populate your sample.
+5) Write code to collect data from each unit of analysis in your sample (e.g. tweets of elected officials)
+6) (if you have time) Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the data you have collected
+7) (if you have time) Outline a hybrid research design (e.g. an app or a bot, a supplemental online survey, or other qualitative methods) that could be used to address the weaknesses of the data you collected, or otherwise improve your ability to answer the research question.

+title: ""Spotify Example""
+author: ""Chris Bail""
+date: ""9/18/2018""
+output: html_document
+---
+
+This is a brief tutorial designed to teach you how to collect data from Spotify in R. Though there are several packages for working with Spotify in R, they do not work very well and are not very well maintained. Therefore, we'll take this opportunity to write some more ""raw"" code that interfaces directly with the API instead of through a package. Much of this code is borrowed from Danielle Montagne- thanks Danielle!
+
+# Getting information on Spotify's Global Top 50 chart
+
+The example that we are going to work through is collecting a dataset that includes a large number of variables about the top 50 songs on Spotify worldwide right now. These include things like the artist's name, website, and markets where the music is being advertised.
+
+First, we need to load the `httr` package and `dplyr` for making calls to the API and data wrangling, respectively
+
+```{r}
+library(httr)
+library(dplyr)
+```
+
+Next, you need to set up your developer account here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ . You will be asked a series of questions about how you intent to use Spotify's API.
+
+If your application is approved, you can view your ""clientID"""" and ""secret"" credentials from the main spotify developer console. Let's create two objects that describe these credentials as follows:
+
+```{r}
+clientID <- ""YOURCLIENTIDHERE""
+secret <- ""YOURSECRETHERE""
+```
+
+First, we make a call to Spotify's ""request API"" which tells us whether or not we have permission to use the API using the `POST` function from the httr package: 
+
+```{r}
+response <- POST(
+  'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
+  accept_json(),
+  authenticate(clientID, secret),
+  body = list(grant_type = 'client_credentials'),
+  encode = 'form',
+  verbose()
+)
+```
+
+Next, we request an access token with our credentials:
+
+```{r}
+mytoken <- content(response)$access_token #extracting access token from the previous API Call
+HeaderValue <- paste0('Bearer ', mytoken) #Authorization is always Bearer + unique token
+```
+
+query with desired endpoint to make API call - this is a 'playlist' call
+This URL format can be broken apart and pasted back together in order to batch API calls. It is important to know the format of the endpoint you want to use, which determines what information you give and get a list of Spotify API endpoints can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/object-model/
+
+
+```{r}
+query <- paste0(""https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/spotifycharts/playlists/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF/tracks"")
+r <- GET(url = query, add_headers(Authorization = HeaderValue)) #The actual API call
+r2 <- httr::content(r) #extracting the JSON information
+```
+
+This is where most of the music-related data is. Other parts of 'r2' have to do with rate limiting and success/failure status of the call
+
+```{r}
+items <- r2$items
+```
+
+Drom exploring the lists (within lists) of data within ""items"" we can see there is a lot of information you might want! But you also might not want all of it, and unlisting everything can create an unweidly dataset. The loop below creates an empty dataframe of the size we want to fill. For this example, we'll just extract the title of the song (name), the credited artist (artist), the track's unique spotify id (id, which can be used for future API calls), and the åsong's overall popularity on spotify (popularity, integer 0 - 100).
+
+```{r}
+global50 <- matrix(nrow= 50, ncol= 4)
+global50<- as.data.frame(global50)
+names(global50)<- c(""name"", ""artist"", ""id"", ""popularity"")
+
+for (i in 1:50) {
+  global50$name[i] <- items[[i]]$track$name
+  global50$artist[i] <- items[[i]]$track$artists[[1]]$name
+  global50$id[i] <- items[[i]]$track$id
+  global50$popularity[i] <- items[[i]]$track$popularity
+}
+```
+
+One can imagine that if you want many more variables (say, all of the available markets since this is chart is not limited to one country), this would not be a very efficient method. If we want all of the information this API call gives us for every track, we might want a different
+method.
+
+Since each song can have a different number of variables, we need to create an empty list to store a dataframe for each song. Thus, the list should be however many songs we have (50)
+
+```{r}
+complete_global50_list <- vector(""list"", length(items))
+```
+
+Then, we put each song's infromation into a dataframe, and store it in the list:
+
+```{r}
+for (i in 1:length(items)) {
+  t <- unlist(r2$items[[i]], use.names = T)
+  complete_global50_list[[i]] <- data.frame(lapply(t, type.convert), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) 
+}
+```
+
+`complete_global50_list` is a list of dataframes, one for each song, which we now have to combine into one: note rbind.fill() appends datasets with different numbers of variables!
+
+```{r}
+complete_global50 <- plyr::rbind.fill(complete_global50_list)
+```
+
+This gives us a dataset of 50 observations, and 226 variables! The data are in wide-form, which is not usually the most useable format...

+
+## Introduction
+
+Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, have become one of the most important ways to access and transfer data online--- and increasingly APIs can even analyze your data as well. Compared to screen-scraping data, which is often illegal, logistically difficult (or both), APIs are a useful tool to make custom requests for data in manner that is well structured and considerably easier to work with than the HTML or XML data described in my previous tutorials on screenscraping. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge about R and other skills described in previous tutorials at the link above.
+
+## What Is an Application Programming Interface?
+
+APIs are tools for building apps or other forms of software that help people access certain parts of large databases. Software developers can combine these tools in various ways---or combine them with tools from other APIs---in order to generate even more useful tools. Most of us use such apps each day. For example, if you install the Spotify app within your Facebook page to share music with your friends, this app is extracting data from Spotify's API and then posting it to your Facebook page by communicating with Facebook's API. There are countless examples of this on the internet at present--- thanks in large part to the advent of Web 2.0, or the historical moment where the internet websites became became much more intertwined and dependent.
+
+The number of APIs that are publicly available has expanded dramatically over the past decade, as the figure below shows. At the time of this writing, the website [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) lists more than 19,638 APIs from sites as diverse as Google, Amazon, YouTube, the New York Times, del.icio.us, LinkedIn, and many others. Though the core function of most APIs is to provide software developers with access to data, many APIs now analyze data as well. This might include facial recognition APIs, voice to text APIs, APIs that produce data visualizations, and so on.
+
+<br>

+
+
+## How Does an API Work?
+
+In order to illustrate how an API works, it will be useful to start with a very simple one. Suppose we want to use the Google Maps API to geo-code a named entity--- or tag the name of a place with latitude and longitude coordinates. The way that we do this, is to write a URL address that a) names the API; and b) includes the text of the query we want to make. If we Googled ""Google Maps API Geocode"" we would eventually be pointed towards the documentation for that API and learn that the base-URL for the Google Maps API is https://maps.googleapis.com. We want to use the geocoding function of this API, so we need a URL that points to this more specific part of the API: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=. We can then add a named entity to the end of the URL such as ""Duke"" using text that looks something like this: follows: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Duke. This link (with some additional text that I will describe below) produces this output in a web browser:
+
+<br>
+![](duke_google.png){width=600px}
+
+
+What we are seeing is something called JSON data. Though it may look somewhat messy at first glance--- lots of brackets, colons, commas, and indendation patterns---it is in fact very highly structured, and capable of storing complex types of data. Here, we can see that our request to geocode ""Duke"" not only identified the city within which it is located (Durham), but also the County, Country, and---towards the end of the page---the latitude and longitude data we were looking for. We will learn how to extract that piece of information later. The goal of the current discussion is to give you an idea of what an API is and how they work. 
+
+If we wanted to search for another geographic location, we could take the link above and replace ""Duke"" with the name of another place-- try it out to give yourself a very rudimentary sense of how an API works.
+
+## API Credentials
+
+Though anyone can make a request to the Google Maps API, getting data from Facebook's API (which Facebook calls the ""Graph"" API) is considerably more difficult. This is because---with good reason---Facebook does not want a software developer to collect data about people whom they do not have a connection with on Facebook. In order to prevent this, Facebook's Graph API---and many other APIs---require you to obtain ""credentials"" or codes/passwords that identify you and determine which types of data you are allowed to access. To illustrate this further, let's take a look at a tool Facebook built to help people learn about APIs. It's called the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?classic=0).
+
+<br>
+![](graphexplorer.png){width=600px}
+
+If you have a Facebook account--- and if you were logged in--- Facebook will generate credentials for you automatically in the form of something called an ""Access Token."" In the screenshot above, this appears in a bar towards the lower bottom part of the screen. This code will give you temporary authorization to make requests from Facebook's Graph API---but ONLY for data that you are allowed to access from your own Facebook page. If you click the blue ""submit"" button at the top right of the screen, you will see some output that contains your name and an ID that Facebook assigns to you. With some more effort, we could use this tool to make API calls to access our friend list, our likes, and so on, but for now, I'm simply trying to make the point that each person gets their own code that allows them to access some, but certainly not all, of the data on Facebook's API. If I were to write in ""cocacola"" instead of ""me"" to get access to data posted by this business, I would get an error message suggesting that my current credentials do not give me access to that data.
+
+Credentials may not only determine your access to people with whom you are connected on a social network, but also other privileges you may have vis-a-vis an API. For example, many APIs charge money for access to their data or services, and thus you will only receive your credentials after setting up an account. As we will see below, some sites also require you to have multiple types of credentials which can be described using a variety of verbiage such as ""tokens"",""keys"", or ""secrets.""
+
+**Now YOU Try It!!!**
+
+The Graph API explorer allows you to search for different fields. Take a moment and try to see whether you can make a call for other types of information about yourself. To do this, you'll have to request different levels of ""permission"" using the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the explorer tool page. You can populate the syntax for different fields using the ""search for a field"" box on the upper right hand side of the page. Don't worry if you can't get the query language right for now---specifying the syntax of an API call requires mastering each API's documentation, which can take a very long time. This tool tries to help you, but it does not work perfectly and constructing the right call may require spending quite a bit of time reading through the API documentation. More importantly-- as you will soon see-- there are a number of R packages that contain functions that make API calls for you that will save you the time and energy necessary to learn the syntax specific to each API.
+
+
+## Rate Limiting
+
+Before we make any more calls to APIs, we need to become familiar with an important concept called ""Rate Limiting."" The credentials in the previous section not only define what type of information we are allowed to access, but also how often we are allowed to make requests for such data. These are known as ""rate limits"" (see figure below). If we make too many requests for data within too short a period of time, an API will temporarily block us from collected data for a period of time that can range from 15 minutes to 24 hours or more, depending upon the API. Rate limiting is necessary so that APIs are not overwhelmed by too many requests that occur at the same time, which would slow down access to data for everyone. Rate limiting also enables large companies such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter, to prevent developers from collecting large amounts of data that could either compromise their user's confidentiality or threaten their business model (since data has such immense value in today's economy).
+
+
+```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
+library(tidyverse)
+
+time <- c(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18)
+tweets_collected <- c(0, 7, 10, 0, 0, 0)
+tweets_requested <- c(0, 7, 11, 14, 18, 23)
+
+data_to_plot <- tibble(time, tweets_collected, tweets_requested)
+
+ggplot(data_to_plot, aes(x = time)) +
+  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = tweets_requested), 
+              fill = ""violetred2"") +
+  geom_line(y = tweets_requested) + 
+  geom_ribbon(aes(x = time, ymin = 0, ymax = tweets_collected), 
+              fill = ""chartreuse3"") +
+  geom_line(y = tweets_collected) + 
+  xlab(""Time (in minutes)"") + 
+  ylab(""Number of Tweets (in thousands)"") + 
+  annotate(""text"", x = 8, y = 3, label = ""# of Tweets Collected"", size = 4) +
+  annotate(""text"", x = 15, y = 3, label = ""# of Tweets Requested"", size = 4) +
+  annotate(""segment"", x = 12, xend = 12, y = 0, yend = 20,
+           linetype = ""dashed"") +
+  annotate(""text"", x = 12, y = 21, label = ""Rate limiting"", size = 4) +
+  theme_classic()
+```
+
+
+The exact timing of rate limiting is not always public, since knowing such time increments could enable developers to ""game"" the system and make rapid requests as soon as rate limiting has ended. Some APIs, however, allow you to make an API call or query in order to learn how many more requests you can make within a given time period before you are rate limited. Even if you do not violate rate limits, you can also be ""throttled"" for making too many requests overall, as the image below shows:
+
+
+```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
+library(tidyverse)
+
+time <- c(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18)
+tweets_collected <- c(0, 7, 10, 0, 0, 0)
+tweets_requested <- c(0, 7, 11, 14, 18, 23)
+
+data_to_plot <- tibble(time, tweets_collected, tweets_requested)
+
+ggplot(data_to_plot, aes(x = time)) +
+  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = tweets_requested), 
+              fill = ""violetred2"") +
+  geom_line(y = tweets_requested) + 
+  geom_ribbon(aes(x = time, ymin = 0, ymax = tweets_collected), 
+              fill = ""chartreuse3"") +
+  geom_line(y = tweets_collected) + 
+  xlab(""Time (in minutes)"") + 
+  ylab(""Number of Tweets (in thousands)"") + 
+  annotate(""text"", x = 8, y = 3, label = ""# of Tweets Collected"", size = 4) +
+  annotate(""text"", x = 15, y = 3, label = ""# of Tweets Requested"", size = 4) +
+  annotate(""segment"", x = 12, xend = 12, y = 0, yend = 20,
+           linetype = ""dashed"") +
+  annotate(""text"", x = 12, y = 21, label = ""Rate limiting"", size = 4) +
+    annotate(""segment"", x = 9, xend = 9, y = 0, yend = 15,
+           linetype = ""dashed"") +
+  annotate(""text"", x = 9, y = 16, label = ""Throttling"", size = 4) +
+  theme_classic()
+```
+
+
+## An Example with Twitter's API
+
+To illustrate the process of obtaining credentials and better understanding rate limiting, I will now present a worked example of how to obtain different types of data from the Twitter API. The first step in this process is to obtain credentials from Twitter that will allow you to make API calls.
+
+Twitter, like many other websites, requires you to create an account in order to receive credentials. To do this, you will need to have a Twitter account, if you do not already. If you create a Twitter account for the purposes of trying out this exercise, note that your application to get credentials (or permission) to use the API may be rejected if your Twitter account is brand new and is never used (an indication that you could be some type of malicious actor starting lots of Twitter accounts to create a bot army, spread misinformation, etc.). You may be asked to confirm your email address or add a mobile phone number because two-factor authentication helps Twitter prevent people from obtaining a large number of different credentials using multiple accounts that could be use to collect large amounts of data without being rate limited.
+
+Once you have a Twitter account, you must visit https://developer.twitter.com to create a developer account by clicking ""Apply for a developer account."" This website is pictured below. Hover over your Twitter profile image on the top right hand side of the page and click ""get started."" 
+
+<br>
+![](twitter_landing.png){width=600px}
+
+
+Next, you will be asked a series of questions about how you want to use Twitter's API. Unfortunately Twitter does not publish exact guidelines about who is allowed to use the API and why-- as far as I know. That said, you can learn a lot by reading Twitter's terms of service. Obvious red flags would include people who are hoping to build tools that somehow harasses Twitter users, hoards Twitter's data (particularly for business purposes), ot other negative purposes. The most important thing is that you are as specific as possible about how you want to use the API. You could write something like ""I am a student at X university trying to teach myself how to use Twitter's API in order to study Y."" You should also give more detail about what type of data you want to collect, and what you plan to do with it. 
+
+Once you accept the terms, your app developer request will go under review by Twitter. At the time of this writing, this process is rather time intensive-- and with good reason, since Twitter is most likely employing large numbers of people to vet everyone who is applying for credentials right now. At the time of this writing, I've seen people get credentials a) instantly; b) within 10 minutes, and c) within more than a week. I even unfortunately know of several cases where people made multiple applications without any of the red flags above (and using different wording) that were ultimately rejected. Hopefully, yours will be approved (and if not, you might try mentioning your problem in a tweet to the @TwitterAPI on Twitter-- this seems to have worked for several people that I know)
+
+
+Once your developer account is approved, you can log in once again and click the ""Create New App"" button at the top right of the screen. Our goal is not to create a fully fledged app at this point, but simply to obtain the credentials necessary to begin making some simple calls to the Twitter API.
+You can name your app whatever you want, describe it however you want, and put in the name of any website you like. One important thing you must do is to put the following text in the ""Callback URL"" text box: `http://127.0.0.1:1410` This number describes the location where the API will return your data-- in this case, it is your web browser (but it could be another site where you want to store the results of the data.).
+
+If you followed the steps above, the name of your application should now appear. Click on it, and then click on the ""Keys and Access Tokens"" tab in order to get your credentials. Unfortunately, Twitter makes developers get two different types of credentials which are listed on that page. These are blurred out in the screenshot below because I do not want people who read this web page to have access to my credneitals, which they could then abuse in various ways: 
+
+<br>
+![](credentials_blurred.png){width=600px}
+
+
+The next step is to define your credentials as string variables in R, which we will then use to authenticate ourselves with the Twitter API. Make sure to select the entire string (by triple clicking),  and make sure that you do not accidentally leave out the first or last digit (or add spaces):
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+# load rtweet
+
+library(rtweet)
+
+# create credentials as objects (these are FAKE CREDENTIALS)
+# you need to replace them with your own.
+
+api_key <- ""aafghaioeriokjasfkljhsa""
+api_secret_key <- ""234897234kasdflkjashk""
+
+```
+
+Next, we are going to install an R package from Github called `rtweet` that helps us make calls to Twitter's API. More specifically, it provides a long list of functions that both a) construct API URL queries for different types of information; and b) parses the resulting data into neat formats. In order to authenticate you may also need to install the `httpuv` package as well (if so, you will receive an error message about this package). 
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+install.packages(""rtweet"")
+```
+
+Now, we are ready to authenticate ourselves vis-a-vis Twitter's API. To do this, we are going to use `rtweet`'s `create_token` function, which makes an API call that passes the credentials we defined above, and then opens a web browser with an authentication dialogue that you must authorize by clicking the blue ""authorize"" button. You should then receive the following message `Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.` Remember that you will need to add the name of your app, instead of `my_awesome_app` listed in the code chunk below
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
+token <- create_token(
+  app = ""my_awesome_app"",
+  consumer_key = api_key,
+  consumer_secret = api_secret_key)
+```
+
+Now, we can take full advantage of all of the many useful functions within the `rtweet` function for collecting data from Twitter. Let's begin by extracting 4,000 tweets that use that mention ""coronavirus.""
+
+```{r}
+library(rtweet)
+covid_19_tweets<-search_tweets(""coronavirus"", n=4000)
+```
+
+
+This code creates a dataframe called `covid_19_tweets` which we may then browse. Let's take a look at the names of the variables in this dataframe:
+
+```{r}
+names(covid_19_tweets)
+```
+
+As you can see, our API call  a lot of interesting variables, including the name and screen name of the user, the text of their tweet, the time of their post, and a variety of other metrics including links to media content and user profiles. A small number of users also enable geolocation of their tweets-- and if that information is available it will appear in this dataset. Here is the full list of variables we collected via our API call above:
+
+Next, let's take a look at the `text` variable, which contains the contents of the tweets we collected:
+
+```{r}
+head(covid_19_tweets$text)
+```
+
+As a brief aside, the `rtweet` function also interfaces nicely with ggplot and other visualization libraries to produce nice plots of the results above. For instance, let's make a plot of the frequency of tweets about Korea over the past few days:
+
+```{r}
+ts_plot(covid_19_tweets, ""secs"") +
+  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
+  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(face = ""bold"")) +
+  ggplot2::labs(
+    x = NULL, y = NULL,
+    title = ""Frequency of Tweets about Covid-19 Around 1pm, May 3, 2020"",
+    subtitle = ""Tweet counts aggregated by second"",
+    caption = ""\nSource: Data collected from Twitter's REST API via rtweet""
+  )
+```
+
+The `search_tweets` function also has a number of useful options or arguments as well. For instance, we can restrict the geographic location of tweets to the United States and English-language tweets using the code below. The code also restricts the results to non-retweets and focuses upon the most recent tweets, rather than a mixture of popular and recent tweets, which is the defualt setting.
+
+```{r}
+covid_geo_tweets <- search_tweets(""coronavirus"",
+  ""lang:en"", geocode = lookup_coords(""usa""), 
+  n = 3000, type=""recent"", include_rts=FALSE
+  )
+```
+
+`rtweet` also enables one to geocode tweets for users who allow Twitter to track their location:
+
+```{r}
+geocoded <- lat_lng(covid_geo_tweets)
+```
+
+We can then plot these results as follows (you may need to install the `maps` package to do this):
+
+```{r}
+library(maps)
+par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
+maps::map(""world"", lwd = .25)
+with(geocoded, points(lng, lat, pch = 20, cex = .50, col = rgb(0, .3, .7, .75)))
+```
+
+We don't see all of our tweets in this diagram for an important reason--- we are only looking at people who allow Twitter to track their location (and this is roughly 1 in 100 people at the time of this writing).
+
+Twitter's API is also very useful for collecting data about a given user. Let's take a look at Bernie Sanders's Twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/SenSanders. There we can see Senator Sanders's description and profile, the full text of his tweets, and---if we click several links---the names of the people he follows, those who follow him, and the tweets which he has ""liked.""
+
+First, let's get his 5 most recent tweets: 
+
+```{r}
+sanders_tweets <- get_timelines(c(""sensanders""), n = 5)
+head(sanders_tweets$text)
+```
+
+Note that you are limited to requesting the last 3,200 tweets, so obtaining a complete database of tweets for a person who tweets very often may not be feasible, or you may need to purchase the data from Twitter itself:
+
+Next, let's get some broader information about Sanders using the `lookup_users` function: 
+```{r}
+sanders_twitter_profile <- lookup_users(""sensanders"")
+```
+
+This creates a dataframe with a variety of additional variables. For example:
+
+```{r}
+sanders_twitter_profile$description
+```
+
+```{r}
+sanders_twitter_profile$location
+```
+
+
+```{r}
+sanders_twitter_profile$location
+```
+
+
+```{r}
+sanders_twitter_profile$followers_count
+```
+
+We can also use the `get_favorites()` function to identify the Tweets Sanders has recently ""liked.""
+
+```{r}
+sanders_favorites<-get_favorites(""sensanders"", n=5)
+sanders_favorites$text
+```
+
+We can also get a list of the people who Sanders follows like this:
+
+```{r}
+sanders_follows<-get_followers(""sensanders"")
+```
+
+This produces the user IDs of those followers, and we could get more information about them if we want using the `lookup_users` function. If we were interested in creating a larger social network analysis dataset centered around Sanders, we could scrape the followers of his followers within a loop.
+
+Looping is an efficient way of collecting a large amount of data, but it will also trigger rate limiting. As I mentioned above, however, Twitter enables users to check their rate limits. The `rate_limit()` function in the rtweets package does this as follows:
+
+```{r}
+rate_limits<-rate_limit()
+head(rate_limits[,1:4])
+```
+
+In the code above I created a dataframe that describes the total number of calls I can make within a given deadline (called reset). In this case, it is 15 minutes. In order to prevent rate limiting within a large loop, it is common practice to employ R's `Sys.sleep` function, which tells R to sleep for a certain number of seconds before proceeding to the next iteration of a loop. 
+
+`rtweet` has a number of other useful functions which I will mention in case they might be useful to readers. `get_trends()` will identify the trending topics on Twitter in a particular area:
+
+```{r}
+get_trends(""New York"")
+```
+
+`rtweet` can even control your Twitter account. For example, you can post messages to your Twitter feed from R as follows:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+post_tweet(""I love APIs"")
+```
+
+I have used this function in past work with bots. See for example, [this paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ygux).
+
+**Now YOU Try It!!!**
+
+To reinforce the skills you've learned in this section, try the following: 1) Collect the most recent 100 tweets from CNN; 2) determine how many people follow CNN on twitter; and, 3) determine if CNN is currently tweeting about any subjects that are trending in your area.
+
+## Wrapping API Calls within a Loop
+
+Very often, one may wish to wrap API calls such as those we have made thus far into a loop to collect data about a long list of users. To illustrate this, let's open a list of the Twitter handles of elected officials in the U.S. that I posted on my Github site:
+
+```{r}
+#load list of twitter handles for elected officials
+elected_officials<-read.csv(""https://cbail.github.io/Senators_Twitter_Data.csv"", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
+
+head(elected_officials)
+```
+
+As you can see, the second column of this .csv file includes the Twitter ""screen names"" or handles we need to make API requests about each elected official. Let's grab each official's most recent 100 tweets, and combine them into a single large dataset of recent tweets by elected officials in the U.S. 
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+#create empty container to store tweets for each elected official
+elected_official_tweets<-as.data.frame(NULL)
+
+for(i in 1:nrow(elected_officials)){
+
+  #pull tweets
+  tweets<-get_timeline(elected_officials$twitter_id[i], n=100)
+  
+  #populate dataframe
+  elected_official_tweets<-rbind(elected_official_tweets, tweets)
+  
+  #pause for five seconds to further prevent rate limiting
+  Sys.sleep(5)
+  
+  #print number/iteration for debugging/monitoring progress
+  print(i)
+}
+
+```
+
+
+This code would take some time to run, of course, since we are collected 100 tweets from 500 different people. You may also get rate limited, depending upon your previous activity and your current rate limits. If so, modify the length of the pause in the `Sys.sleep` command above. You may also notice some error messages in your output-- these could occur because Senators change their Twitter handle, or because they have an account but no tweets, or other such errors.
+
+
+## Working with Timestamps
+
+There is one more skill that will be useful for you to have in order to work with Twitter data. Very often, we want to track trends over time or subset our data according to different time periods. If we browse the variable that describes the time each tweet was created, however, we see that it is not in a format that we can easily work with in r:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+head(for_analysis$created_at)
+```
+
+To manage these types of string variables that describe dates, it is often very useful to convert them into a variable of class ""date."" There are several ways to do this in R, but here is the way to do it using the `as.Date` function in base R. 
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+for_analysis$date<-as.Date(for_analysis$created_at, format=""%Y-%m-%d"")
+head(for_analysis$date)
+```
+
+Now, we can subset the data using conventional techniques. For example, if we wanted to only look at tweets for August, we could do this:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+august_tweets<-for_analysis[for_analysis$date>""2018-07-31""&
+                              for_analysis$date<""2018-09-01"",]
+```
+
+
+## Challenges of Working with APIs
+
+By now it is hopefully clear that APIs are an invaluable resource for collecting data from the internet. At the same time, it may also be clear that the process of obtaining credentials, avoiding rate limiting, and understanding the unique jargon employed by those who create each API can mean a lot of hours sifting through the documentation of an API---particularly where there are not well functioning R packages for interfacing with the API in question. If you have to develop your own custom code to work with an API--- or if you need information that is not obtainable using functions within an R package, you may find it useful to browse the source code of the R functions we have discussed above in order to see where they pass the API query language necessary to produce the results we worked with above.
+
+
+## A List of APIs of Interest
+
+There are numerous databases that describe popular APIs on the web, including the aforementioned Programmable Web, but also a variety of crowd-source and user generated lists as well:

+## Introduction
+
+This is part of a series of tutorials I've written on collecting digital trace data from sites such as Twitter, or other internet sources. These earlier tutorials demonstrated some of the potential of digital trace data, but also highlighted many limitations of these new wellsprings of data as well. For example, digital trace data are often incomplete, inaccessible, non-representative, unstructured--and thus difficult to work with-- and sensitive in nature. Because of these limitations, there is growing consensus that hybrid approaches are needed that combine digital trace data with more conventional methods such as surveys.
+
+
+## Building Apps for Social Science Research
+
+The term ""app"" has come to refer to an impressive array of software-- from mobile tools we use to find our way around to desktop-based tools for editing photos. In [this article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YMC1SNHIzWU5jSXc/view), I make the case that apps can also be extremely useful for social scientists. More specifically, I argue that apps can provide a vehicle for social scientists to collect digital trace data alongside survey data. There are numerous advantages of such a hybrid strategy-- for example, surveys can be used to collect demographic information about those who produce social media texts in order to evaluate issues of coverage and representativeness. Or, surveys can be used to collect information about other confounding factors. What is more, authentication dialogues within apps provide a natural opportunity to obtain informed consent from social media users-- though this was not done in a comprehensive manner in past studies such as those that became central to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
+
+To demonstrate the potential of apps for social science research it will be useful to provide a more detailed example. Some years ago, I was interested in how social media posts go viral. I was specifically interested in public posts on Facebook fan pages by advocacy organizations and other civil society groups. Using the procedures described in my previous tutorials, I could easily collect the text of all messages and counts of the number of times they were shared or commented upon via Facebook's Graph API. Yet I was not able to answer important questions about who had viewed such posts, and precisely how they interacted with them. I was also not able to measure critical features of the non-profit groups that I was studying such as their financial resources, number of staff, and their use of offline tactics to call attention to their cause.
+
+To solve this problem, I created a web-based app called ""Find Your People."" Find Your People allowed non-profit organizations to get high-quality analysis of their social media outreach via comparisons to their peers who had also installed the app. In return, organizations agreed to share non-public aggregate data about their audiences with me known as Facebook ""insights data""-- these include metrics such as the number of people age 18-24 who viewed a post on a given day, but not the names of those people or other information that could be used to easily identify them. In addition, Find Your People asked non-profit organizations to complete a brief web-based survey that allowed me to collect additional information about the organization. I recruited non-profit groups working in the fields of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Human Organ Donation, respectively, to install the apps. Response rates to these requests were relatively high, and I identified minimal evidence of response bias. I used this tool to develop a new theory of how social media posts go viral. Readers who are interested in this theory-- or those would would like to see more detail about how the apps were employed-- can view [this paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/42/11823.full.pdf?with-ds=yes), [this paper](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303181), [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/179SpJoLuyOyOgOFEenlziOPmfkVLjnFH/view), or [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YRmR4cWxteDd0TXM/view).
+
+## How to Build Apps
+
+When I created the Find Your People app, app-building required somewhat involved knowledge of programming in multiple languages, web design, and cloud computing. Yet the R program [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) has become a gamechanger. Shiny is an interactive app building tool that you can use directly from rStudio. In addition to an easy to use, integrated app building tool, RStudio also provides a variety of tools to host and deploy apps on the web with the click of a button. Finally, there is a vibrant community of Shiny app developers--- many of whom share the code they used to create their apps on sites such as [this one](https://www.showmeshiny.com/). 
+
+There are a number of excellent tutorials online about how to use Shiny, including this [excellent video series](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/). Many of these are simple tools for interactive data visualization, yet Shiny enables development of apps for just about anything. Indeed, API calls can be embedded within Shiny apps to produce analyses of a user's twitter data. Consider, for example, this [nice example](https://aj17.shinyapps.io/twitteranalytics/). Shiny allows you to create text boxes, multiple choice buttons, and many other of the standard fare of online surveys. Together, these tools could be used to create the functionality that I developed in the stone age with much less time and energy.
+
+Though Shiny has numerous advantages, it is limited in its capacity to work natively with the mobile devices that most of us use many times each day. For this reason, I suspect many of the best apps built for social science research will also employ other platforms. One of my favorites is Flutter. Flutter is a new tool created by Google, which allows one to simultaneously create mobile apps for both iOS and Android Devices. At the time of this writing, Flutter also builds to web-based apps, though that functionality is not recommended for production. Perhaps the coolest part of Flutter is that it allows you run apps natively while you build them-- updating the aesthetics and functionality of the apps in a realistic mobile-device simulator while you code.
+
+Getting Flutter up and running requires some time and patience. I recommend using a combination of Visual Studio Code and the iOS simulator that ships with mac's Xcode (or the Android equivalent, Android Studio). There are a variety of great tutorials that can help you get set up with this workflow. [This one](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) is my favorite so far. Though Flutter is still relatively new, there are also a variety of [great sample apps](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/master/INDEX.md) that you can use as a guide to build your own. My Polarization Lab will soon open-source a mobile chat platform we are building to study politics and social media, and I hope that will help inspire more academics to use this impressive tool.

+
+## Building Bots for Social Science Research
+
+Another recent trend in studies that employ digital trace data is the creation of bots, or automated social media accounts. In a very [creative study](https://internet.psych.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/532-Master/532-UnitPages/Unit-06/Munger_PB_2017.pdf), political science PhD Student Kevin Munger build an app designed to examine racial harrassment on Twitter. He created two automated accounts-- one of which had a profile picture with a white person and the other with an African-American person. The bots were then designed to a) search Twitter for tweets by white men that contain racist language; and then b) reply to these tweets with condemnations of the racist language. Notwithstanding some limitations of the research design, this study suggests that people are more likely to stop using racist language if they are chastized by the bot with the White person pictured in its Twitter profile than the African-American person pictured in its Twitter profile.

+<br>
+
+In a [recent study](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ygux), my coauthors and I created bots designed to disrupt social media echo chambers in order to examine how they shape the formation of political views. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment. 
+
+<br>

+<br>
+
+This study was somewhat more involved than the Munger study (and also much more expensive) since it combined not only observation of publicly-available Twitter data, but also linked these data to surveys of a large group of people. The bots were also somewhat more sophisticated in that they were created using a variety of sophisticated tools from social network analysis and the field of natural language processing. Still, these bots were not terribly difficult to create, and I describe the steps needed to create a bot such as ours in the following section.
+
+## How to Create a Bot
+
+One way to create a bot is to write a .R script that is hosted on a single computer and runs throughout the study period. Yet such a strategy presents numerous obstacles. First, it ties up the R session on a machine and it therefore cannot be used for other routine work. Users have to either have another computer or a lot of time on their hands. It is possible for users to run multiple R sessions on a single machine, and activity within each R session should not interfere with other active sessions. However, multiple R sessions may not be appropriate if activity within one or more R sessions proves too computationally intensive.  Second, bots that are hosted on a single laptop or desktop can typically only be accessed or controlled from that machine. Third, all machines are prone to failure, and if the machine that hosts the app fails, valuable time can go by during a field experiment before the researcher becomes aware of the failure.
+
+For these reasons, I've hosted the bots that I've built in my work on a cloud machine running Rstudio via an Amazon EC2 server. This may sound complicated, but it is actually rather straightforward. The first step is to create an ""Amazon Web Services"" account. If you are a student, you may be eligible for 750 hours of free computing time. If you are not a student, you may be pleased to see that cloud computing time can be purchased quite inexpensively---particularly if you do not require significant computing power. The second step is to find a ""Machine image"" that will provide Amazon with instructions about how to create a cloud machine that can run RStudio. There are now many of these available, but one of the more popular ones is [Louis Aslet's](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/). Click on the ""region"" closest to you to minimize latency (the time with which it takes for instructions to move from your location to the location of the Amazon server farm). You will also need to follow additional instructions on the aforementioned website in order to configure a ""security group"" and open up incoming HTTP traffic via port 80. You then cut and paste the ""Public IP or DNS"" address from your Amazon EC2 page into your web browser and you will be redirected to an Rstudio log-in page. By default, your user name and password are set to ""Rstudio,"" but you can change these immediately after loggin in (which is good practice to create additional security and prevent others from using your cloud machine). **Keep in mind that as long as your machine is on or running, you will be charged by the hour, so make sure to shut down your cloud machines once you are done using them.** If using an Amazon EC2 server is not an option available to you, it is highly recommended that you host your bot on a machine that you can access through a remote desktop application.
+
+Regardless of where you host your bot, you will need to write some code to make it perform the functions necessary for your study. Below, I present code for a very primitive example of a bot that retweets a message about computational social science each hour for 24 days. 
+
+Note that this code assumes that you have already authenticated with Twitter in some manner. **Be certain that your bot falls within Twitter's terms of service, and make sure to avoid rate limiting (to learn about how to identify your rate limits, see my previous tutorial on Application Programming Interfaces.**)
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+
+for (i in 1:24){
+  #Search for 50 recent tweets about computational social science
+  css_tweets<-search_tweets(""Computational Social Science"", n=50, include_rts = FALSE)
+  #Randomly pick one of them, which appears in the `text` variable with the `css_tweets` dataframe
+  lucky_tweet<-sample(css_tweets$text, 1)
+  post_tweet(lucky_tweet)
+  Sys.sleep(3600)
+  #3600 seconds is 60 minutes
+}
+
+```
+
+
+Needless to say, bots can be much more sophisticated-- writing code to make bots interact with people---or sample candidates for interaction in real time---requires more code, though with a few ""if/else"" loops and a bit of elbow grease, this can often be accomplished in suprisingly few lines of code.
+
+Most studies will also require data collection of those whom the bot interacts with. Such data can be collected within the bot code, or in a separate script that monitors accounts that are selected for interaction by a bot. Once again, make sure your bot does not conflict with Twitter's terms of service, and does not abuse rate limits.
+
+
+## Ethical Issues in App and Bot-Based Research
+
+Ethical issues in app and bot-based research are manifold and IRB guidelines for such research are in their infancy. For these reasons, it is vital--- in my view---that computational social scientists hold themselves to a standard that is higher than IRB because there will no doubt be ethical issues on the horizons that we do not yet know exist. The Cambridge Analytica scandal may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of the potential for data collected by apps to be repurposed or merged with other datasets for other purposes. Such issues, combined with the perrenial issue of data security and the challenge of maintaining confidentiality with increasingly detailed data-- or meta data--should inspire researchers to carefully review their plans not only with the IRB, but also with other members of the computational social science community who can help them ensure that their research is ethical and safe.

+## **What is Screen-Scraping?**
+
+Screenscraping refers to the process of automatically extracting data from web pages, and often a long list of websites that cannot be mined by hand. As the figure below illustrates, a typical screenscraping program a) loads the name of a web-page to be scraped from a list of webpages; b) downloads the website in a format such as HTML or XML; c) finds some piece of information desired by the author of the code; and d) places that information in a convenient format such as a ""data frame"" (which is R speak for a dataset). Screenscraping can also be used to download other types of content as well, however, such as audio-visual content. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge about R and other skills described in previous tutorials at the link above.

+<br><br>
+
+
+## **Is Screen-Scraping Legal?**
+
+In the early years of the internet, screen-scraping was a very common practice because there were not yet widespread legal norms surrounding the protection of data on the internet. This has changed drastically in recent decades as the value of data on websites has become obvious, and bots or automated computer programs can easily wreak havoc by collecting data from websites and repurposing it for nefarious purposes. The very first thing you should consider before screen-scraping a website is whether you are allowed to do so. The easiest way to do this is to visit the ""Terms of Service"" (sometimes abbreviated as ""Terms"") which often appears at the bottom of a web page. These days, most websites have a ""robots.txt"" policy that specifies  rules about automated data collection on the site, and an increasing number of sites do not allow such practices (especially larger websites such as Facebook, the New York Times, or Instagram). You should consult professional legal advice to determine whether you have permission to scrape a website.
+
+
+## **Reading a Web-Page Into R**
+
+If you've identified a web page you'd like to scrape, the first step in writing a screen-scraping program is to download the source code into R. To do this we are going to install the `rvest` package, authored by Hadley Wickham, which provides a number of very useful functions for screen-scraping. (Note: You may also need to install the `selectr` package.)
+
+```{r, messages=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
+install.packages(""rvest"")
+install.packages(""selectr"")
+```
+
+
+We are going to begin by scraping [this very simple web page from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000). I describe the page as ""simple"" because it does not have a lot of interactive features which require sophisticated types of web programming such as javascript, which---as we will see in a later example--- can be particularly difficult to work with.
+
+This is what the webpage linked above looks like to us when we visit it via a browser such as Explorer or chrome:
+
+<br><br>
+![](1 WHO Rankings.png)
+<br><br>
+
+But this is not what the web page actually looks like to our browser. To view the ""source code"" of the web page, we can use Chrome's dropdown menu called ""developer"" and then click ""View Source."" We then see the page in its most elemental form, called an HTML file, which is a long file that contains both the text of the web page as well as a long list of instructions about how the text, images, and other components of the webpage should be rendered by the browser:
+
+<br><br>
+![](source_code.png)
+
+<br><br>
+
+To download the source code into R, we can use the `read_html` function from the `rvest` package that we just installed above (Note: you may also have to load/install the `selectr` package):
+
+```{r, messages=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, waning=FALSE}
+library(rvest)
+library(selectr)
+```
+
+```{r}
+
+wikipedia_page<-read_html(""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000&oldid=876464764"")
+```
+
+
+To verify that our code worked, we can ""browse"" the `wikipedia_page` object that we just created:
+
+```{r}
+wikipedia_page
+```
+
+As this output shows, we have successfully loaded the web page into our R Studio session. But this was the easy part.
+
+## **Parsing HTML**
+
+Perhaps the most challenging part of screen-scraping is extracting the piece of information you want out of the html file. This is challenging because this information is almost always hidden deep within the source code, which can be very difficult to navigate. Fortunately, as the figure below shows, web page source code such as HTML or XML has a ""tree like"" structure that allows you to gradually hone in on the part of the web page where the information you want lives.
+
+<br><br>
+![](html_tree.png)
+<br><br>
+
+In order to find out where the data we want is located within this tree-like structure, we can use a handy tool within Chrome called ""Developer Tools"":
+
+<br><br>
+![](developer_tools.png)
+<br><br>
+
+This tool provides you with an interactive interface where you can view the webpage alongside the source code. When you right click on the part of the web page you are interested in and choose ""inspect"", the Developer Tool highlights the part of the source code where the information you want is located. In the figure below, I have highlighted the table that describes health metrics for different countries that are described on the Wikipedia page linked above.
+
+<br><br>
+![](using_developer.png)
+<br><br>
+
+When I inspected the part of the web page I am trying to scrape by right-clicking, the part of the HTML below became highlighted:
+
+<br><br>
+![](inspected.png)
+<br><br>
+
+Sometimes, finding the exact part of the code where the data you want lives requires some trial and error. In this case, I discovered that I had to select an earlier line in the code to identify the entire table I want to scrape instead of just one line.
+
+The next step is to identify a string of numbers and letters called the ""Xpath"" for this part of the source code. The Xpath describes the precise part of the HTML where the data I want lives. I identify the X path by right clicking on the highlighted section of the pane of the Developer Tools that displays the html code:
+
+<br><br>
+![](xpath.png)
+<br><br>
+
+Now that I have the xpath, I can use this information to narrow my search within the HTML file for the Table that I want to extract using the `html_nodes` function which passess the xpath as an argument as pictured in the code below:
+
+```{r}
+section_of_wikipedia<-html_node(wikipedia_page, xpath='//*[@id=""mw-content-text""]/div/table')
+head(section_of_wikipedia)
+```
+
+As the output above shows, I am now getting closer, but I am still not quite where I want to be. The top of the output tells me that the data are in table format (rather than simple text format), so I am going to use the `html_table` function to extract the table embedded within the html code:
+
+
+```{r}
+health_rankings<-html_table(section_of_wikipedia)
+head(health_rankings[,(1:2)])
+```
+
+As the output above shows, I now finally have the data I wanted in the form of a data frame or dataset called ""health_rankings."" This was quite a bit of work, however, and recall that this was a very simple type of webpage. Also, it is worth noting that groups of Wikipedia pages have a very similar format which makes them very amenable to screen-scraping. If, on the other hand, I was scraping a list of sites from multiple domains-- each of which have their own complicated structure--- I could spend days or weeks writing code to scrape them. In this scenario, many people may find that it is easier to collect the data by hand, or hire workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to extract the information you might want from a list of web pages.
+
+One final note: often the web page that you wish to scrape will contain XML instead of HTML (or in addition to HTML). In this case, the `rvest` package has a series of functions to parse XML such as `xml` and `xml_node`.
+
+**Now YOU Try It!!!**
+
+In order to practice your new skill, pick another web page and scrape some information from it. Hint: if you choose text to scrape, you may find `rvest`'s `html_text` function quite useful. Also, if you are unable to extract the piece of information that you want, it may not be possible, and you might need to use one of the other techniques for screen-scraping described below. 
+
+## **Parsing With the CSS Selector**
+
+It is often the case---particularly with more complex web pages--- that the procedures described above will not work. In this case it is useful to know about an alternative to the Xpath code described above: the ""CSS Selector,"" which is another snippet of code that helps you find the nugget of HTML you want to extract from a web page.
+
+Let's look at an example of scraping a list of ""events"" from [Duke University's main webpage](https://www.duke.edu/). If you visit this page, you will see that the example is considerably more complex than the aforementioned Wikipedia example. There are not only more types of information presented on the page but multiple ways of accessing it. In our hypothetical example, the information we want changes on a daily basis (the list of major events that will occur at Duke on that day). 
+
+In order to identify the CSS Selector, we are going to employ a popular Chrome plug-in called the [Selector Gadget](http://selectorgadget.com/). This is an interactive tool---not unlike the Chrome Developer Tool described above--- that allows one to interact with a web page in order to reveal the CSS Selector. After installing the tool, a small icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar that is a hand holding a microscope. When you click on this tool, a new pane will appear at the bottom of your browser window that will eventually reveal the CSS Selector-- it can also be used to identify the Xpath, incidentally. This pane is pictured at the bottom of the figure below:
+
+<br><br>
+![](First_CSS.png)
+
+To reveal the CSS selector for the part of the page you want, click on that part of the page. The part of the page should appear highlighted in Green. However, you will most likely also see other parts of the page, highlighted in yellow, that you do not want:
+
+<br><br>
+![](Second_CSS.png)
+
+Click on one of the yellow parts until only the green part you originally highlighted remains. As you click, you may note that the CSS Selector that is selected at the bottom of the page changes. This can take some trial and error, and the Selector Gadget is imperfect. It works best when you try to click different parts highlighted in yellow, and try out the resultant CSS selectors it identifies in an iterative fashion using the code below.
+
+Once we have identified the CSS selector we think is attached to the piece of information we want, we can pass it as an argument in `rvest`'s `html_nodes` function as follows:
+
+```{r}
+duke_page<-read_html(""https://www.duke.edu"")
+duke_events<-html_nodes(duke_page, css=""li:nth-child(1) .epsilon"")
+html_text(duke_events)
+
+```
+
+As the output above shows, we have now collected information about the events we wanted. Note, however, that it includes some messy characters with backslashes, ts, and ns. These are called ""html tags"", and we will learn how to clean them up in an upcoming tutorial on basic text processing in R.
+
+
+## **Scraping With Selenium**
+
+Sometimes, our interest in scraping web pages involves more interaction with a web browser. For instance, suppose we wanted to visit the main web pages of a series of universities and run a search for ""data science."" This would require inputting data into a search bar on a series of sites, and then scraping the resultant data. In order to accomplish such tasks, it is ocassionally useful to automate your entire web browser. This means that we will write code that will tell our computer to a) open a web browser; b) load a web page; c) interact with the web page by clicking on the search bar and entering text; and c) downloading the resultant data.
+
+`RSelenium` is a powerful package for automating tasks on your computer, and---with a bit of elbow grease---it can be used to automate your browser and scrape information as well. To write code for Rselenium, you need to input keyboard strokes such as ""Tab,""Ctrl,"" or ""Enter"" and intersperse them with the text you want to input (in the example above, we might pass the text ""data science"").
+
+Unfortunately, installing RSelenium can be a bit involved since it requires more sophisticated interfacing between your RStudio session and your Operating System than the typical R package. The instructions that follow will help you install R Selenium on Mac OSX.13.4. First, you will need to install another piece of software called the Java SE Development Kit. Choose the most appropriate version for your machine at [this link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Then, you will need to download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install it on your machine. When asked for login in credentials, you will need to provide the user name you setup to download Docker, not your email address. Once you have done that, we will make Docker available to RSelenium using the following command:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+#now we install selenium from Docker
+system('docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-chrome')
+```
+
+Next, you will need to install `RSelenium`, which is finally again hosted on CRAN. (For a couple of months earlier this year that was not the case, but you were able to use a workaround to install it from Github using the `devtools` package.) After downloading and loading the package, we start the Selenium server and open Chrome with commands below (If you don't have Chrome installed, you can start Firefox instead using the following command `rD <- rsDriver(browser = ""firefox"")`.
+
+Note: When you run the `rsDriver` function to set up an RSelenium session, RSelenium will pick the latest available version of chromedriver by default. Oftentimes this latest version reflects a developer release of Chrome that may not yet be available even as a beta, resulting in an incompatibility that will stop RSelenium from working. To fix this, use `binman::list_versions(""chromedriver"")` to identify which version of chromedriver matches your installed version of Chrome (in Chrome, select ""About Google Chrome"" to identify your installed version). Once identified, specify this version as the value of the `chromever` argument in `rsDriver`. [Thanks to this Stack Overflow page for the fix!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55201226/session-not-created-this-version-of-chromedriver-only-supports-chrome-version-7/56173984#5617398)
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+install.packages(""RSelenium"")
+library(RSelenium)
+
+# Check available versions of chromedriver
+binman::list_versions(""chromedriver"")
+
+# start a Selenium server
+rD <- rsDriver(browser = c(""chrome""), chromever = ""75.0.3770.8"")
+
+# open the browser
+remDr <- rD$client
+
+
+```
+
+Now, we can launch the Duke web page above as follows:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+remDr$navigate(""https://www.duke.edu"")
+```
+
+Next, we need to use the Selector Gadget or some other method to identify the part of the web page where the ""search"" bar is. After some trial and error, I discovered the CSS selector was `fieldset input`:
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+search_box <- remDr$findElement(using = 'css selector', 'fieldset input')
+```
+
+You will now see that the search bar is highlighted in your browser. The only thing remaining is to ask RSelenium to type in ""data science"" into the query box and then hit the return button using the `sendKeysToElement` function. The code for the ""Enter"" or ""Return"" key stroke is the second argument we pass to the aforementioned function (`\uE007`)
+
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
+search_box$sendKeysToElement(list(""data science"", ""\uE007""))
+```
+
+This code should result in a search for ""data science"" within the Duke web page.
+
+
+## **Screen-Scraping Within a Loop**
+
+Regardless of which approach to screenscraping you use, you will often want to scrape not just one page, but many pages. In this case, you can simply embed any of the techniques above within a `for` loop that reads a list of web pages you wish to scrape. Once again, be aware that websites often have different structures, so the way you extract information on one site may be very different from another. This is one of the main reasons that screen scraping can be difficult--- and also another reason why screenscraping has fallen out of fashion in addition to the legal issues highlighted above. If you do proceed to scrape a large list of web pages, you may want to build in some ""error handling"" into your code, so that it does not break every time your code does not function---note that some errors may also be created by violating a website's terms of service.
+
+## **So... When Should I Use Screen-Scraping?**
+
+By now it is hopefully clear that screenscraping can often be more trouble than its worth--- particularly in the age of Application Programming Interfaces, which I will discuss in another tutorial. Still, there are some cases where screenscraping remains useful. One ideal use case is where you are scraping different pages within one web site again and again. An example might include a local government website that posts information on events. Such a website may have the same ""root"" URL, but different suffixes that describe different days, months, etc. Assuming the structure of the pages are identical, one can then write a loop which switches out the end of the URL for different dates (using whatever naming convention is used by the site).
+
+Another common reason to scrape a web page is if it is prohibitively difficult to copy and paste the information you seek from a website. Examples are extremely long pieces of text, or those that are embedded within complex tables (though again, parsing the HTML to identify the precise text you require could take a very long time as well). In such cases, it may be useful to consider Amazon Mechanical Turk workers as an alternative approach to collecting your data.

+## What is Digital Trace Data?
+
+The past decade has witnessed an increasingly voluminous amount of digital data that is produced on the internet which describes human behavior and other objects of scholarly inquiry. As the figure below shows, recent decades have not only witnessed an increase in the amount of text based data, but also increased computing power which is increasingly necessary to analyze it. Together, these two shifts hold the potential to significantly expand the scope of research in many different fields.
+
+![](Big Data.png){width=500px}
+<br><br>
+
+## Strengths of Digital Trace Data
+
+I will begin by discussing some of the positive aspects of digital trace data, and then move on to some of the challenges. In so doing, I draw upon Matt Salganik's Book [*Bit by Bit*](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/) which I highly recommend---not only for a more detailed discussion of digital trace data, but the nascent field of computational social science more broadly.
+
+### Always On
+
+One of the most attractive features of digital trace data is that it is continuously collected, unlike surveys which usually only provide a brief snapshot of the social world. As the image below indicates, social media can occasionally provide a glimpse of major events such as protests, revolutions, or stock market surges, *as they unfold*.
+
+![](egypt-arab-spring-facebook-twitter.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Non-Reactive
+
+Another important advantage of digital trace data is that it is non-reactive, or not produced via interaction between researchers and those who they study. In some cases, this may lead to significant reductions in social desirability bias or other forms of interviewer effects. Consider, for example, the use of Google search data to study violent radicalization, a subject which could not be studied with survey data-- what type of extremists would describe their violent intentions to a survey researcher? Yet in the [paper](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaao5948) pictured below, my colleagues and I discovered that people do reveal some digital traces that might indicate they might aspire to engage in such behavior.
+
+![](bail_merhout_ping.png){width=500px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Captures Social relationships
+
+Digital trace data are also somewhat unusual in that they often describe social relationships. Whereas conventional survey techniques usually only measure characteristics of individual subjects, for example, digital trace data can often be used to measure social relationships such as the network of elected officials, media organizations, and advocacy groups pictured below from a [recent paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216) I wrote with colleagues.
+<br><br>
+
+![](bail_network.png){width=500px}
+<br><br>
+
+## Weaknesses of Digital Trace Data
+
+Despite the considerable advantages of digital trace data described above, they also create a range of challenges for empirical observation and causal inference.
+
+### Inaccessible
+
+An even more formidable challenge is that data are often inaccessible. Though Twitter provides a massive amount of publicly available data, the vast majority of data generated on Facebook is private. Though some Facebook pages such as ""fan pages"" have default public settings, the vast majority of Facebook users set their default privacy settings in a manner that only allows people to access their data if they are affiliated with each other as ""friends.""
+<br><br>
+
+![](locked.jpg){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Non-Representative
+
+Another core challenge facing those who wish to work with digital trace data is that a random sample of Facebook or Twitter users is not representative of the broader population of the United States, or most other countries. The figure below presents some data from the Wall Street Journal on user demographics of several social media sites that demonstrates significant differences by platform according to race. On the other hand, usage of Facebook has become so widespread that some readers might be surprised to see how much more representative it has become of the U.S. public in recent years.
+<br><br>
+
+![](social_media_demographics.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+
+### Drifting
+
+MySpace was once the largest social media site in the world, according to some analysts. It is now resides in the graveyard of internet history like so many other websites. This raises the risk of ""drift"" in digital trace data-- platforms not only shift in their overall popularity (which of course has important implications for their representativeness), but also according to who uses them and why. Though Facebook was once the most popular platform for U.S. undergraduates, many have shifted to Instagram or Snapchat---possibly in reaction to the uptick of Facebook usage by their parents' generation :)
+<br><br>
+
+![](myspace_2012_original_logo.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+
+### Algorithmic Counfounding
+
+Sometimes, digital trace data that appear to describe human behavior actually reflect changes in the way humans interact with algorithms. One popular example of this is the ""parable of Google Flu."" Google Flu was once a popular tool that allowed users to estimate the prevalence of influenza using Google search data. The tool was so accurate that some suggested it should displace official surveys from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Yet in early 2013, Google estimates were far higher than those from the CDC. [Researchers later discovered](https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/parable-google-flu%C2%A0traps-big-data-analysis) that estimates of influenza had been inflated by google advertising links about the flu that people were clicking on that had appeared in their web browsers after they searched for information about symptoms of the common cold. This is sometimes refered to as ""blue-team"" dynamics.
+<br><br>
+
+![](Google Flu.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Unstructured
+
+Digital Trace data are also often very messy. Newcomers to the field often assume that because data are generated in digital format that they are well structured, easily searchable, and quickly transposable across different formats. As we shall see in future tutorials, this is most often not true--- a recent New York Times article indicated that data scientists spend upwards of 80% of their time cleaning data!
+<br><br>
+
+![](The-Dirty-Little-Secret-of-Big-Data.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Sensitive
+
+Digital trace data are also often very sensitive. Recent events involving Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica Political Consulting Firm underscore the dangers of unfettered access to large troves of digital trace data, but there were many more---arguably more invasive---data breaches long before this recent event. One such incident, pictured below, involved European researchers who mined data from the internet dating site OK Cupid and then publicly released their data online. 
+<br><br>
+
+![](ok cupid.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+### Incomplete
+
+Though much is often made of the size and scale of digital trace data that can be collected, newcomers to the field are often surprised about the amount of data that are often missing or incomplete. Consider, for example, a study of bullying behavior on social media--- many of the most abusive posts that might be of interest to a researcher are often removed by Facebook before one might attempt to study them.
+<br><br>
+
+![](nocomment.jpg){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+
+### Elite Bias
+
+You know the famous saying, ""history is written by the victors""? Much digital trace data is also created by people who are elites, and who might provide selective or incomplete accounts of what is going on, or worse.
+<br><br>
+
+![](books.jpg){width=400px}
+
+
+### Positivity-Bias
+
+Finally, digital trace data often have performative dimensions. Many people do not report negative information about themselves online precisely because they know that their friends, colleagues--- or other people they do not know--- may be watching them. This creates another common form of bias in social media research.
+<br><br>
+
+![](failures.png){width=400px}
+<br><br>
+
+
+## Exploring Text-Based Datasets
+
+Before we proceed to learn how to collect data from Twitter and other sources, it is worth noting that there are numerous high-quality text datasets that are publicly available on the internet. These include very large corpora from the New York Times, Google, Wikipedia, Reuters, and many other sites). I curate a crowd-sourced list of promising datasets [here](http://bit.ly/1JA1CF3).
+
+
+**Now YOU Try It**
+
+1) Pair up with your neighbor. 
+2) Pick a dataset from the list in the previous section---or another one that you are hoping to analyze after this course;
+3) Identify at least three strengths and weaknesses of the dataset drawing upon this introduction, or other sources.
+
+
+## The Future of Digital Trace Data
+
+After reviewing so many of the negatives of digital trace data, you may be questioning whether its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I am overall optimistic about the future of digital trace data research because it is in its infancy. As Salganik (2016) writes, the field has recently experienced a Gartner hype cycle (see figure below). In my opinion, reaching the ""plateau of productivity"" will most likely require hybrid approaches that combine digital trace data analysis alongside more conventional modes of research such as survey analysis. I've also written at length about this issue [elsewhere](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YMC1SNHIzWU5jSXc/view), and specifically the potential of using app technology to integrate digital trace data collection with survey research.

+output: html_document
+---
+
+Our curriculum for text analysis covered a broad range of techniques for analyzing unstructured text. Yesterday, the group exercise was designed to help you get to know each other better and explore possible topics for a group research project that you might launch during the second week by designing a study that would employ digital trace data. Today, we are going to have a more structured group exercise designed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different text analysis techniques when they are applied to a single dataset.
+
+1) Everyone will be randomized into groups of 5 people.
+
+2) Load the dataframe of tweets by President Trump that we analyzed during the discussion of Dictionary-Based text methods:
+
+```{r}
+load(url(""https://cbail.github.io/Trump_Tweets.Rdata""))
+```
+
+Note that this data frame also includes counts of the number of times each of his tweets were retweeted or ""liked."" NOTE: IF YOU PREFER TO USE A DATASET YOUR GROUP COLLECTED DURING YESTERDAY'S EXERCISE, IT IS OK TO USE THIS AS WELL.
+
+3) Use at least two of the techniques discussed in the videos to pull out features from the text of Trump's tweets (e.g. substantive themes, topics, sentiment), or the text-based dataset you collected yesterday.
+
+4) Work together to identify whether any features of Trump's Twitter language predict the number of retweets or likes his messages receive. If you are working with other Twitter data, feel free to predict likes by other users as well.
+
+5) Load the dataframe of daily approval ratings for President Trump from the five-thirty-eight website's github:
+
+```{r}
+trump_approval<-read.csv(""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_topline.csv"")
+```
+
+6) Work together to determine whether there are any features of Trump's Twitter language that have an association with his overall approval ratings.
+
+7) Produce a visualization that describes the findings of your analysis and share it in our slack channel with a brief description of what you did.

+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+

+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+

 ## Questions
 <br>
 
-**1. Create a bar plot to show the average ages of democrat and republican congress members. Now do the same for M and F genders (this second part should include members of all parties).**
 
+**1. In your own words, describe what a function is and provide one example of how you might use it in a data science 
 <br/>
 
-**2. Create two bar charts: one that shows the total number of social media accounts among democrats and republicans (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube), and one that shows the average number of accounts per-politician for each party. Which political party has more social media accounts? Which party has a higher per-politician average?**
 
-Note: there are several ways to accomplish this. You could use `gather` again and then `group_by` and `summarise` within politician and then within party, or you could use `mutate` to get counts for each politican and then average by party. Any other approach is also fine.
+**2. Packages in R can contain many useful functions/commands. If you didn't know what a certain function did, or how it worked, where within RStudio would you look to learn more / see example code? Where would you look outside RStudio?**
 
 <br/>
 
-**3. Use an inner join to combine the columns of the `committees` dataframe with the columns of `congress`, and create a plot showing the average number of committees that democrats and republicans belong to. Next create a plot showing the averages by gender (note: this second part should include members of other parties as well).**
 
+**3. Write a function that takes a character vector as an argument and returns a character vector containing the first letters of each element in the original vector. To show that it works, test it on the character vector `sentence` defined below.**
+```{r}
+sentence <- c('you', 'only', 'understand', 'data', 'if', 'data', 'is', 'tidy')
+# your answer here
+```
 <br/>
 
 
+**4. Create your own function which accepts a birthyear vector and returns an approximate current age, then use it on the `birthyear` column of the `congress` dataframe to create a new `age` column with `mutate`.**
 
-**4. Create a bar plot showing the number of members that belong to the 10 largest congressional committees (i.e. committees with the largest number of members). The bars should be sorted based on committee sizes.**
-
-Note: Our standard for visualizations is that each plot should have axis labels, all labels must be readable, and we should easily be able to tell what your figure is showing. Failure to do this will result in point deductions.
+Note: functions used inside mutate accept single columns from the original dataframe and return a column or vector of the same size. This is a valuable tool for developing your workflow.
 
 <br/>
 
 
-**5. Create a single bar plot that shows the average age of the committees with the 5 highest and lowest average ages. The bars should be sorted based on average committee ages. Which committees have the highest and lowest average ages?**
+**5. Write a function that accepts a date string and returns the day of the week it corresponds to, then use it to create a new column of `congress` representing the weekday of the birth of each politician using `mutate`.**
 
 <br/>
 
 
-**6. Create a line graph showing the total number of politician births in each decade since the 1930's, with separate lines for senate and house members (see the `type` column). The labels on your x-axis should look like ""1930's"", ""1940's"", and so on, and your legend should show values ""Senator"" and ""Representative"" (i.e. not `rep` and `sen`).**
-
-Note: The plotted lines may not be continuous if there were no births in some decades.
+**6. Write a function that accepts a dataframe with the columns `birthday` and `full_name`, and prints the names and ages of the `k` oldest *representatives* in congress (i.e. not including senators) using a ""for loop"". In this sense, `k` is an arbitrary number that should be given as an argument to the function - set the default value to be 5. If you use the dataframe as the first argument, you can use the pipe operator (""%>%"") to pass the dataframe directly to the function. Define your function such that you can use it like this: `congress %>% print_oldest(3)`.**
 
 <br/>
 
 
-
-
-**7. Create a bar chart showing the frequency of politician births by month and another bar chart showing politician births by weekday. The x-labels should be month names and weekday names, respectively, and appear in chronological order.**
-
-Note: you can use the `lubridate` package methods to get weekday and month names.
+**7. Starting with the function from the previous question, change it such that if k > 5, it only prints the first 5. Test isusing this code: `congress %>% print_oldest(100)`.**

She started her academic career as a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and finished her PhD at the University of Goettingen in 2017. Her research can be divided roughly into two main areas: One the one hand she investigates the determinants of cross-cultural cooperation behavior; on the other hand, her research is dedicated to discrimination (e.g., in selection processes) and potential interventions (e.g., quota rules) to reduce discrimination. For her research she combines methods of economics and psychology to test social psychological theories. Furthermore, she is committed to transparency and replicability in research and communicates these principles as part of her teaching activities.""

 <p>Common words such as “the”, “and”, “bot”, “for”, “is”, etc. are often described as “stop words,” meaning that they should not be included in a quantitative text analysis. Removing stop words is fairly easy regardless of whether you are working with a Corpus object or a tidytext object assuming you are working with a widely used language such as English. Let’s begin with the former, using the <code>tm_map</code> function as follows:</p>

 <p>Another common step in pre-processing text is to remove all punctuation marks. This is generally considered important, since to an algorithm the punctuation mark “,” will assume a unique numeric identity just like the term “economy.” It is often therefore advisable to remove punctuation marks in an automated text analysis, but there are also a number of cases where this can be problematic. Consider the phrase, “Let’s eat, Grandpa” vs. “Lets eat Grandpa.”</p>
 <p>To remove punctuation marks within a <code>Corpus</code> object, we use this code:</p>
 <pre class=""r""><code>trump_corpus &lt;- tm_map(trump_corpus, content_transformer(removePunctuation))</code></pre>
+<pre><code>## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(trump_corpus,
+## content_transformer(removePunctuation)): transformation drops documents</code></pre>
 <p>An advantage of <code>tidytext</code> is that it removes punctuation automatically.</p>
 <p><strong>Removing Numbers</strong></p>
 <p>In many texts, numbers can carry significant meaning. Consider, for example, a text about the 4th of July. On the other hand, many numbers add little to the meaning of a text, and so it has become commonplace in the field of natural language processing to remove them from an analysis.</p>
 <p>One can remove numbers from a <code>Corpus</code> object as follows:</p>

+<pre><code>## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(trump_corpus,
+## content_transformer(removeNumbers)): transformation drops documents</code></pre>
 <p>This is also very easy in <code>tidytext</code> using basic <code>grep</code> commands (note the <code>&quot;\\b\\d+\\b&quot;</code> text here tells R to remove all numeric digits and the ‘-’ sign means grep excludes them rather than includes them):</p>

-
-## Eligibility
-
-We do not have spesific eligibility criteria for participants: there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.
-About 20-30 participants will be invited.
-
-The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience.
-Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute.
-Participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language.
-Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
-
-We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions:
-
- 1. research and teaching in the area of computational social science
- 1. contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
- 1. likelihood to benefit from participation and potential for high impact research
- 1. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
- 1. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.
-
-Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
-
-## How To Apply
-
-Applicants must submit the following documents:
-

+
+## Eligibility
+
+We do not have specific eligibility criteria for participants: there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.
+About 20-30 participants will be invited.
+
+The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience.
+Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute.
+Participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R or Python programming language.
+Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
+
+We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along several dimensions:
+
+ 1. research and teaching in computational social science
+ 1. contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
+ 1. likelihood to benefit from participation and potential for high impact research
+ 1. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
+ 1. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.
+
+Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
+

 Starting in 2018, the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) began including partner locations in order to increase the number of participants. The Summer Institute is two weeks long and partner locations typically involve: 1) pre-recorded or live-streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; 2) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; 3) live-streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and 4) participant-led group research projects. This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.
 
-The Summer Institutes are highly modular and the open source curriculum can be adapted to the skills and interests at each location. The minimum budget to support an in-person partner location is about $15,000, but the exact amount depends on local conditions. Virtual events can be done more cheaply. Here are some [sample budgets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2BimdmWNLSVYqTmwrEZcQxv3j3LCyU0hQyW0vZYCk8/edit?usp=sharing) for in-person events. If you have more questions about budgeting—--or grants that may be available to support partner locations--—please contact us at rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.

If you have more questions about budgeting—or grants that may be available to support partner locations—please contact us at rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
 
 In order to ensure quality and consistency, all partner locations must have a former participant of SICSS as one of the local organizers. If you don’t have any SICSS alumni at your organization, you can contact us about finding a former participant that could collaborate with you. For example, in 2019 Matti Nelimarkka (SICSS ‘17) collaborated with Akın Ünver to run a partner location in [Istanbul, Turkey](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/istanbul/) (Kadir Has University).

He  received his PhD from the Computer Science Department at University of Port Harcourt Nigeria. His research focused on the application of domain specific modelling approach to modelling engineering designs in the oil and gas transmission pipeline systems. Much of his work is directed at requirements within a particular domain, where the structure and behaviour of the prototype system capturing stakeholders design intents that depict various design scenarios were examined. His research methodology was hinged on Domain Specific modelling of Model Driven Engineering Technologies that tackles complexities in domains through language formalisms that could be beyond the utilization of stakeholders. This language formalism is simply a reusable software layer that can be tailored to any specific domain through requirements engineering for greater stakeholder output.""

 There is one more skill that will be useful for you to have in order to work with Twitter data. Very often, we want to track trends over time or subset our data according to different time periods. If we browse the variable that describes the time each tweet was created, however, we see that it is not in a format that we can easily work with in r:
 
-```{r}
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
 head(for_analysis$created_at)
 ```
 
 To manage these types of string variables that describe dates, it is often very useful to convert them into a variable of class ""date."" There are several ways to do this in R, but here is the way to do it using the `as.Date` function in base R. 
 
-```{r}
+```{r, eval=FALSE}
 for_analysis$date<-as.Date(for_analysis$created_at, format=""%Y-%m-%d"")
 head(for_analysis$date)
 ```
 
 Now, we can subset the data using conventional techniques. For example, if we wanted to only look at tweets for August, we could do this:
 
-```{r}
+```{r, eval=FALSE}

 The textnets package includes two functions to visualize text networks created in the previous steps. The `VisualizeText` function creates a network diagram where nodes are colored by their cluster or modularity class (see previous section). In many cases, text networks will be very dense (that is, there will be a very large number of edges because most documents share at least one word). Visualizing text networks therefore creates inherent challenges, because such dense networks are very cluttered. To make text networks more readable, the `VisTextNet` function employs a ""network backbone"" technique which deletes edges using a disparity filter algorithm to trim edges that are not informative. By default, the function uses a tuning parameter called alpha which is set to .25. The user can specify different levels of alpha to trim more or less of the network. The `VisTextNet` function also includes an argument that determines which nodes will be labeled, since network visualizations with too many node labels can be difficult to interpret. The user specifies an argument called `label_degree_cut` which specifies the degree, or number of connections, that nodes should have to get labeled. For example, if the user only wants nodes that have at least 0 connections to other nodes to be labeled, they would use the following code:
 
 ```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
-VisTextNet(sotu_text_network, label_degree_cut = 0, eval=FALSE)
+VisTextNet(sotu_text_network, label_degree_cut = 0)

-# Introduction
+## Introduction
 
 Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, have become one of the most important ways to access and transfer data online--- and increasingly APIs can even analyze your data as well. Compared to screen-scraping data, which is often illegal, logistically difficult (or both), APIs are a useful tool to make custom requests for data in manner that is well structured and considerably easier to work with than the HTML or XML data described in my previous tutorials on screenscraping. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge about R and other skills described in previous tutorials at the link above.
 
-# What Is an Application Programming Interface?
+## What Is an Application Programming Interface?
 
 APIs are tools for building apps or other forms of software that help people access certain parts of large databases. Software developers can combine these tools in various ways---or combine them with tools from other APIs---in order to generate even more useful tools. Most of us use such apps each day. For example, if you install the Spotify app within your Facebook page to share music with your friends, this app is extracting data from Spotify's API and then posting it to your Facebook page by communicating with Facebook's API. There are countless examples of this on the internet at present--- thanks in large part to the advent of Web 2.0, or the historical moment where the internet websites became became much more intertwined and dependent.
 
 The number of APIs that are publicly available has expanded dramatically over the past decade, as the figure below shows. At the time of this writing, the website [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) lists more than 19,638 APIs from sites as diverse as Google, Amazon, YouTube, the New York Times, del.icio.us, LinkedIn, and many others. Though the core function of most APIs is to provide software developers with access to data, many APIs now analyze data as well. This might include facial recognition APIs, voice to text APIs, APIs that produce data visualizations, and so on.

-# How Does an API Work?
+## How Does an API Work?
 
 In order to illustrate how an API works, it will be useful to start with a very simple one. Suppose we want to use the Google Maps API to geo-code a named entity--- or tag the name of a place with latitude and longitude coordinates. The way that we do this, is to write a URL address that a) names the API; and b) includes the text of the query we want to make. If we Googled ""Google Maps API Geocode"" we would eventually be pointed towards the documentation for that API and learn that the base-URL for the Google Maps API is https://maps.googleapis.com. We want to use the geocoding function of this API, so we need a URL that points to this more specific part of the API: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=. We can then add a named entity to the end of the URL such as ""Duke"" using text that looks something like this: follows: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Duke. This link (with some additional text that I will describe below) produces this output in a web browser:
 
 <br>
-![](duke_google.png)
+![](duke_google.png){width=600px}
 
 
 What we are seeing is something called JSON data. Though it may look somewhat messy at first glance--- lots of brackets, colons, commas, and indendation patterns---it is in fact very highly structured, and capable of storing complex types of data. Here, we can see that our request to geocode ""Duke"" not only identified the city within which it is located (Durham), but also the County, Country, and---towards the end of the page---the latitude and longitude data we were looking for. We will learn how to extract that piece of information later. The goal of the current discussion is to give you an idea of what an API is and how they work. 
 
 If we wanted to search for another geographic location, we could take the link above and replace ""Duke"" with the name of another place-- try it out to give yourself a very rudimentary sense of how an API works.
 
-# API Credentials
+## API Credentials
 
 Though anyone can make a request to the Google Maps API, getting data from Facebook's API (which Facebook calls the ""Graph"" API) is considerably more difficult. This is because---with good reason---Facebook does not want a software developer to collect data about people whom they do not have a connection with on Facebook. In order to prevent this, Facebook's Graph API---and many other APIs---require you to obtain ""credentials"" or codes/passwords that identify you and determine which types of data you are allowed to access. To illustrate this further, let's take a look at a tool Facebook built to help people learn about APIs. It's called the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?classic=0).
 
 <br>
-![](apiexplorer.png)
+![](graphexplorer.png){width=600px}
 
 If you have a Facebook account--- and if you were logged in--- Facebook will generate credentials for you automatically in the form of something called an ""Access Token."" In the screenshot above, this appears in a bar towards the lower bottom part of the screen. This code will give you temporary authorization to make requests from Facebook's Graph API---but ONLY for data that you are allowed to access from your own Facebook page. If you click the blue ""submit"" button at the top right of the screen, you will see some output that contains your name and an ID that Facebook assigns to you. With some more effort, we could use this tool to make API calls to access our friend list, our likes, and so on, but for now, I'm simply trying to make the point that each person gets their own code that allows them to access some, but certainly not all, of the data on Facebook's API. If I were to write in ""cocacola"" instead of ""me"" to get access to data posted by this business, I would get an error message suggesting that my current credentials do not give me access to that data.
 
@@ -60,136 +57,188 @@ Credentials may not only determine your access to people with whom you are conne
 The Graph API explorer allows you to search for different fields. Take a moment and try to see whether you can make a call for other types of information about yourself. To do this, you'll have to request different levels of ""permission"" using the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the explorer tool page. You can populate the syntax for different fields using the ""search for a field"" box on the upper right hand side of the page. Don't worry if you can't get the query language right for now---specifying the syntax of an API call requires mastering each API's documentation, which can take a very long time. This tool tries to help you, but it does not work perfectly and constructing the right call may require spending quite a bit of time reading through the API documentation. More importantly-- as you will soon see-- there are a number of R packages that contain functions that make API calls for you that will save you the time and energy necessary to learn the syntax specific to each API.
 
 
-# Rate Limiting
+## Rate Limiting
 
-Before we make any more calls to APIs, we need to become familiar with an important concept called ""Rate Limiting."" The credentials in the previous section not only define what type of information we are allowed to access, but also how often we are allowed to make requests for such data. These are known as ""rate limits."" If we make too many requests for data within too short a period of time, an API will temporarily block us from collected data for a period of time that can range from 15 minutes to 24 hours or more, depending upon the API. Rate limiting is necessary so that APIs are not overwhelmed by too many requests that occur at the same time, which would slow down access to data for everyone. Rate limiting also enables large companies such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter, to prevent developers from collecting large amounts of data that could either compromise their user's confidentiality or threaten their business model (since data has such immense value in today's economy).

-The exact timing of rate limiting is not always public, since knowing such time increments could enable developers to ""game"" the system and make rapid requests as soon as rate limiting has ended. Some APIs, however, allow you to make an API call or query in order to learn how many more requests you can make within a given time period before you are rate limited.

-Twitter, like many other websites, requires you to create an account in order to receive credentials. To do this, we need to visit https://apps.twitter.com. There, you will have to create a developer account by clicking ""Apply for a developer account."" You may be asked to confirm your email address or add a mobile phone number because two-factor authentication helps Twitter prevent people from obtaining a large number of different credentials using multiple accounts that could be use to collect large amounts of data without being rate limited---or, for other nefarious purposes such as creating armies of bots that produce spam or attempt to influence elections.

Some APIs, however, allow you to make an API call or query in order to learn how many more requests you can make within a given time period before you are rate limited. Even if you do not violate rate limits, you can also be ""throttled"" for making too many requests overall, as the image below shows:

-Next, you will be asked whether you want to request a developer account for an organization or for personal use. You will most likely want to choose personal use (the organizational account can allow one person to request credentials that can be shared across a large group of people which could be useful if you work within a lab or other business). 
+## An Example with Twitter's API
+
+To illustrate the process of obtaining credentials and better understanding rate limiting, I will now present a worked example of how to obtain different types of data from the Twitter API. The first step in this process is to obtain credentials from Twitter that will allow you to make API calls.
+
+Twitter, like many other websites, requires you to create an account in order to receive credentials. To do this, you will need to have a Twitter account, if you do not already. If you create a Twitter account for the purposes of trying out this exercise, note that your application to get credentials (or permission) to use the API may be rejected if your Twitter account is brand new and is never used (an indication that you could be some type of malicious actor starting lots of Twitter accounts to create a bot army, spread misinformation, etc.). You may be asked to confirm your email address or add a mobile phone number because two-factor authentication helps Twitter prevent people from obtaining a large number of different credentials using multiple accounts that could be use to collect large amounts of data without being rate limited.
+
+Once you have a Twitter account, you must visit https://developer.twitter.com to create a developer account by clicking ""Apply for a developer account."" This website is pictured below. Hover over your Twitter profile image on the top right hand side of the page and click ""get started."" 
 
 <br>
-![](organization.png)
+![](twitter_landing.png){width=600px}
 
 
-Next, you will be asked a series of questions about how you want to use Twitter's API. Unfortunately Twitter does not publish exact guidelines about who is allowed to use the API and why-- as far as I know. That said, you can learn a lot by reading Twitter's terms of service. Obvious red flags would include people who are hoping to build tools that somehow harasses Twitter users, hoards Twitter's data (particularly for business purposes), ot other negative purposes. You will see these terms after you describe why you want to apply for credentials.

Obvious red flags would include people who are hoping to build tools that somehow harasses Twitter users, hoards Twitter's data (particularly for business purposes), ot other negative purposes. The most important thing is that you are as specific as possible about how you want to use the API. You could write something like ""I am a student at X university trying to teach myself how to use Twitter's API in order to study Y."" You should also give more detail about what type of data you want to collect, and what you plan to do with it. 
 
-Once you accept the terms, your app developer request will go under review by Twitter. At the time of this writing, this process is rather time intensive-- and with good reason, since Twitter is most likely employing large numbers of people to vet everyone who is applying for credentials right now. At the time of this writing, I've seen people get credentials within a day or two, and others who have waited more than a week. I even unfortunately know of several cases where people made multiple applications without any of the red flags above (and using different wording) that were ultimately rejected. Hopefully, yours will be approved (and if not, you might try mentioning your problem in a tweet to the @TwitterAPI on Twitter-- this seems to have worked for several people that I know)

 Once your developer account is approved, you can log in once again and click the ""Create New App"" button at the top right of the screen. Our goal is not to create a fully fledged app at this point, but simply to obtain the credentials necessary to begin making some simple calls to the Twitter API.
 You can name your app whatever you want, describe it however you want, and put in the name of any website you like. One important thing you must do is to put the following text in the ""Callback URL"" text box: `http://127.0.0.1:1410` This number describes the location where the API will return your data-- in this case, it is your web browser (but it could be another site where you want to store the results of the data.).
 
 If you followed the steps above, the name of your application should now appear. Click on it, and then click on the ""Keys and Access Tokens"" tab in order to get your credentials. Unfortunately, Twitter makes developers get two different types of credentials which are listed on that page. These are blurred out in the screenshot below because I do not want people who read this web page to have access to my credneitals, which they could then abuse in various ways: 
 
 <br>
-![](credentials_blurred.png)
+![](credentials_blurred.png){width=600px}
 
 
 The next step is to define your credentials as string variables in R, which we will then use to authenticate ourselves with the Twitter API. Make sure to select the entire string (by triple clicking),  and make sure that you do not accidentally leave out the first or last digit (or add spaces):
 
 ```{r, eval=FALSE}
-app_name<-""YOURAPPNAMEHERE""
-consumer_key<-""YOURKEYHERE""
-consumer_secret<-""YOURSECRETHERE""
-access_token<-""YOURACCESSTOKENHERE""
-access_token_secret<-""YOURACCESSTOKENSECRETHERE""
-```
+# load rtweet
 
+library(rtweet)
 
-Next, we are going to install an R package from Github called `rtweet` that helps us make calls to Twitter's API. More specifically, it provides a long list of functions that both a) construct API URL queries for different types of information; and b) parses the resulting data into neat formats. In order to authenticate you may also need to install the `httpuv` package as well (if so, you will receive an error message about this package). If you have never installed a package from Github before you will need the `devtools` package to do this.
+# create credentials as objects (these are FAKE CREDENTIALS)
+# you need to replace them with your own.
+
+api_key <- ""aafghaioeriokjasfkljhsa""
+api_secret_key <- ""234897234kasdflkjashk""
 
-```{r, eval=FALSE}
-library(devtools)
-install_github(""mkearney/rtweet"")
 ```
 
-Now, we are ready to authenticate ourselves vis-a-vis Twitter's API. To do this, we are going to use `rtweet`'s `create_token` function, which makes an API call that passes the credentials we defined above, and then opens a web browser with an authentication dialogue that you must authorize by clicking the blue ""authorize"" button. You should then receive the following message `Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.`

+Now, we can take full advantage of all of the many useful functions within the `rtweet` function for collecting data from Twitter. Let's begin by extracting 4,000 tweets that use that mention ""coronavirus.""
 
 ```{r, echo=FALSE}
 library(rtweet)
+covid_19_tweets<-search_tweets(""coronavirus"", n=4000)
 ```
 
-```{r}
-korea_tweets<-search_tweets(""#Korea"", n=50, include_rts = FALSE)
-```
 
-This code creates a dataframe called `korea_tweets` which we may then browse. Let's take a look at the first ten tweets, which `rtweet` stores as a variable called `text`.
+This code creates a dataframe called `covid_19_tweets` which we may then browse. Let's take a look at the names of the variables in this dataframe:
 
 ```{r}
-head(korea_tweets$text)

 ```
 
-Note that this API call also generated a lot of other interesting variables, including the name and screen name of the user, the time of their post, and a variety of other metrics including links to media content and user profiles. A small number of users also enable geolocation of their tweets-- and if that information is available it will appear in this dataset. Here is the full list of variables we collected via our API call above:

+Next, let's take a look at the `text` variable, which contains the contents of the tweets we collected:
 
 ```{r}
-names(korea_tweets)
+head(covid_19_tweets$text)
 ```
 
 As a brief aside, the `rtweet` function also interfaces nicely with ggplot and other visualization libraries to produce nice plots of the results above. For instance, let's make a plot of the frequency of tweets about Korea over the past few days:
 
 ```{r}
-library(ggplot2)
-ts_plot(korea_tweets, ""3 hours"") +
+ts_plot(covid_19_tweets, ""secs"") +
   ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
   ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(face = ""bold"")) +
   ggplot2::labs(
     x = NULL, y = NULL,
-    title = ""Frequency of Tweets about Korea from the Past Day"",
-    subtitle = ""Twitter status (tweet) counts aggregated using three-hour intervals"",
+    title = ""Frequency of Tweets about Covid-19 Around 1pm, May 3, 2020"",
+    subtitle = ""Tweet counts aggregated by second"",
     caption = ""\nSource: Data collected from Twitter's REST API via rtweet""
   )
-
 ```
 
 The `search_tweets` function also has a number of useful options or arguments as well. For instance, we can restrict the geographic location of tweets to the United States and English-language tweets using the code below. The code also restricts the results to non-retweets and focuses upon the most recent tweets, rather than a mixture of popular and recent tweets, which is the defualt setting.
 
 ```{r}
-nk_tweets <- search_tweets(""korea"",
+covid_geo_tweets <- search_tweets(""coronavirus"",
   ""lang:en"", geocode = lookup_coords(""usa""), 
-  n = 1000, type=""recent"", include_rts=FALSE
+  n = 3000, type=""recent"", include_rts=FALSE
   )
 ```
 
 `rtweet` also enables one to geocode tweets for users who allow Twitter to track their location:
 
 ```{r}
-geocoded <- lat_lng(nk_tweets)
+geocoded <- lat_lng(covid_geo_tweets)
 ```
 
 We can then plot these results as follows (you may need to install the `maps` package to do this):
 
 ```{r}
 library(maps)
 par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
-maps::map(""state"", lwd = .25)
-with(geocoded, points(lng, lat, pch = 20, cex = .75, col = rgb(0, .3, .7, .75)))
+maps::map(""world"", lwd = .25)
+with(geocoded, points(lng, lat, pch = 20, cex = .50, col = rgb(0, .3, .7, .75)))
 ```

There we can see Senator Sanders's description and profile, the full text of his tweets, and---if we click several links---the names of the people he follows, those who follow him, and the tweets which he has ""liked.""

-Now that we've collected the data, let's create a simple model that predicts the retweet count of tweets.

-
-```{r}
-library(dplyr)

-
-Next, because our data is so skewed, we could use something like a negative binomial regression model to examine the association between the various predictors in our data and the outcome. To do this we will use the `glm.nb` function from the `MASS` package:
-
-```{r}
-
-library(MASS)
-summary(glm.nb(retweet_count~

-
-Unsurprisingly, senators who have more followers tend to produce tweets that have more retweets. Additionally, Republicans appear to get fewer retweets than Democrats. This could result from the fact that Twitter users who follow politics--or at least Senators--are more likely to be Democrats, or because Democrats produce tweets that are somehow more appealing, or any number of other confounding factors (so we probably shouldn't read too much into this finding without a more careful analysis).

 By now it is hopefully clear that APIs are an invaluable resource for collecting data from the internet. At the same time, it may also be clear that the process of obtaining credentials, avoiding rate limiting, and understanding the unique jargon employed by those who create each API can mean a lot of hours sifting through the documentation of an API---particularly where there are not well functioning R packages for interfacing with the API in question. If you have to develop your own custom code to work with an API--- or if you need information that is not obtainable using functions within an R package, you may find it useful to browse the source code of the R functions we have discussed above in order to see where they pass the API query language necessary to produce the results we worked with above.

+## Introduction
 
 This is part of a series of tutorials I've written on collecting digital trace data from sites such as Twitter, or other internet sources. These earlier tutorials demonstrated some of the potential of digital trace data, but also highlighted many limitations of these new wellsprings of data as well. For example, digital trace data are often incomplete, inaccessible, non-representative, unstructured--and thus difficult to work with-- and sensitive in nature. Because of these limitations, there is growing consensus that hybrid approaches are needed that combine digital trace data with more conventional methods such as surveys.

-# Building Apps for Social Science Research
+## Building Apps for Social Science Research
 
 The term ""app"" has come to refer to an impressive array of software-- from mobile tools we use to find our way around to desktop-based tools for editing photos. In [this article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YMC1SNHIzWU5jSXc/view), I make the case that apps can also be extremely useful for social scientists. More specifically, I argue that apps can provide a vehicle for social scientists to collect digital trace data alongside survey data. There are numerous advantages of such a hybrid strategy-- for example, surveys can be used to collect demographic information about those who produce social media texts in order to evaluate issues of coverage and representativeness. Or, surveys can be used to collect information about other confounding factors. What is more, authentication dialogues within apps provide a natural opportunity to obtain informed consent from social media users-- though this was not done in a comprehensive manner in past studies such as those that became central to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
 
 To demonstrate the potential of apps for social science research it will be useful to provide a more detailed example. Some years ago, I was interested in how social media posts go viral. I was specifically interested in public posts on Facebook fan pages by advocacy organizations and other civil society groups. Using the procedures described in my previous tutorials, I could easily collect the text of all messages and counts of the number of times they were shared or commented upon via Facebook's Graph API. Yet I was not able to answer important questions about who had viewed such posts, and precisely how they interacted with them. I was also not able to measure critical features of the non-profit groups that I was studying such as their financial resources, number of staff, and their use of offline tactics to call attention to their cause.
 
 To solve this problem, I created a web-based app called ""Find Your People."" Find Your People allowed non-profit organizations to get high-quality analysis of their social media outreach via comparisons to their peers who had also installed the app. In return, organizations agreed to share non-public aggregate data about their audiences with me known as Facebook ""insights data""-- these include metrics such as the number of people age 18-24 who viewed a post on a given day, but not the names of those people or other information that could be used to easily identify them. In addition, Find Your People asked non-profit organizations to complete a brief web-based survey that allowed me to collect additional information about the organization. I recruited non-profit groups working in the fields of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Human Organ Donation, respectively, to install the apps. Response rates to these requests were relatively high, and I identified minimal evidence of response bias. I used this tool to develop a new theory of how social media posts go viral. Readers who are interested in this theory-- or those would would like to see more detail about how the apps were employed-- can view [this paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/42/11823.full.pdf?with-ds=yes), [this paper](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303181), [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/179SpJoLuyOyOgOFEenlziOPmfkVLjnFH/view), or [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YRmR4cWxteDd0TXM/view).

 When I created the Find Your People app, app-building required somewhat involved knowledge of programming in multiple languages, web design, and cloud computing. Yet the R program [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) has become a gamechanger. Shiny is an interactive app building tool that you can use directly from rStudio. In addition to an easy to use, integrated app building tool, RStudio also provides a variety of tools to host and deploy apps on the web with the click of a button. Finally, there is a vibrant community of Shiny app developers--- many of whom share the code they used to create their apps on sites such as [this one](https://www.showmeshiny.com/).

 Getting Flutter up and running requires some time and patience. I recommend using a combination of Visual Studio Code and the iOS simulator that ships with mac's Xcode (or the Android equivalent, Android Studio). There are a variety of great tutorials that can help you get set up with this workflow. [This one](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) is my favorite so far. Though Flutter is still relatively new, there are also a variety of [great sample apps](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/master/INDEX.md) that you can use as a guide to build your own.

-# Building Bots for Social Science Research
+## Building Bots for Social Science Research
 
 Another recent trend in studies that employ digital trace data is the creation of bots, or automated social media accounts. In a very [creative study](https://internet.psych.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/532-Master/532-UnitPages/Unit-06/Munger_PB_2017.pdf), political science PhD Student Kevin Munger build an app designed to examine racial harrassment on Twitter. He created two automated accounts-- one of which had a profile picture with a white person and the other with an African-American person. The bots were then designed to a) search Twitter for tweets by white men that contain racist language; and then b) reply to these tweets with condemnations of the racist language. Notwithstanding some limitations of the research design, this study suggests that people are more likely to stop using racist language if they are chastized by the bot with the White person pictured in its Twitter profile than the African-American person pictured in its Twitter profile.

 In a [recent study](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ygux), my coauthors and I created bots designed to disrupt social media echo chambers in order to examine how they shape the formation of political views. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment.

 This study was somewhat more involved than the Munger study (and also much more expensive) since it combined not only observation of publicly-available Twitter data, but also linked these data to surveys of a large group of people. The bots were also somewhat more sophisticated in that they were created using a variety of sophisticated tools from social network analysis and the field of natural language processing. Still, these bots were not terribly difficult to create, and I describe the steps needed to create a bot such as ours in the following section.
 
-# How to Create a Bot
+## How to Create a Bot
 
 One way to create a bot is to write a .R script that is hosted on a single computer and runs throughout the study period. Yet such a strategy presents numerous obstacles. First, it ties up the R session on a machine and it therefore cannot be used for other routine work. Users have to either have another computer or a lot of time on their hands. It is possible for users to run multiple R sessions on a single machine, and activity within each R session should not interfere with other active sessions. However, multiple R sessions may not be appropriate if activity within one or more R sessions proves too computationally intensive.  Second, bots that are hosted on a single laptop or desktop can typically only be accessed or controlled from that machine. Third, all machines are prone to failure, and if the machine that hosts the app fails, valuable time can go by during a field experiment before the researcher becomes aware of the failure.
 
@@ -92,7 +90,7 @@ Needless to say, bots can be much more sophisticated-- writing code to make bots
 Most studies will also require data collection of those whom the bot interacts with. Such data can be collected within the bot code, or in a separate script that monitors accounts that are selected for interaction by a bot. Once again, make sure your bot does not conflict with Twitter's terms of service, and does not abuse rate limits.
 
 
-# Ethical Issues in App and Bot-Based Research
+## Ethical Issues in App and Bot-Based Research
 
 Ethical issues in app and bot-based research are manifold and IRB guidelines for such research are in their infancy. For these reasons, it is vital--- in my view---that computational social scientists hold themselves to a standard that is higher than IRB because there will no doubt be ethical issues on the horizons that we do not yet know exist. The Cambridge Analytica scandal may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of the potential for data collected by apps to be repurposed or merged with other datasets for other purposes. Such issues, combined with the perrenial issue of data security and the challenge of maintaining confidentiality with increasingly detailed data-- or meta data--should inspire researchers to carefully review their plans not only with the IRB, but also with other members of the computational social science community who can help them ensure that their research is ethical and safe.

-# Introduction
 
-This is the first in a series of tutorials I've created about collecting data from web-based sources such as Twitter and analyzing them using various forms of automated text analysis. Before we proceed to the technical aspects of these techniques, I want to give you some sense of where the came from:

-# What is Digital Trace Data?
+## What is Digital Trace Data?
 
 The past decade has witnessed an increasingly voluminous amount of digital data that is produced on the internet which describes human behavior and other objects of scholarly inquiry. As the figure below shows, recent decades have not only witnessed an increase in the amount of text based data, but also increased computing power which is increasingly necessary to analyze it. Together, these two shifts hold the potential to significantly expand the scope of research in many different fields.

-I will begin by discussing some of the positive aspects of digital trace data, and then move on to some of the challenges. In so doing, I draw upon Matt Salganik's Book [*Bit by Bit*](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/) which I highly recommend not only for a more detailed discussion of digital trace data, but the nascent field of computational social science more broadly.

-**Always On**
+### Always On
 
 One of the most attractive features of digital trace data is that it is continuously collected, unlike surveys which usually only provide a brief snapshot of the social world. As the image below indicates, social media can occasionally provide a glimpse of major events such as protests, revolutions, or stock market surges, *as they unfold*.

-**Non-Reactive**
+### Non-Reactive
 
-Another important advantage of digital trace data is that it is non-reactive, or not produced via interaction between researchers and those who they study. In some cases, this may lead to significant reductions in social desirability bias or other forms of interviewer effects. Consider, for example, the use of Google search data to study self-induced abortion (see figure below)
+Another important advantage of digital trace data is that it is non-reactive, or not produced via interaction between researchers and those who they study. In some cases, this may lead to significant reductions in social desirability bias or other forms of interviewer effects. Consider, for example, the use of Google search data to study violent radicalization, a subject which could not be studied with survey data-- what type of extremists would describe their violent intentions to a survey researcher? Yet in the [paper](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaao5948) pictured below, my colleagues and I discovered that people do reveal some digital traces that might indicate they might aspire to engage in such behavior.

-**Captures Social relationships**
 
-Digital trace data are also somewhat unusual in that they often describe social relationships. Whereas conventional survey techniques usually only measure characteristics of individual subjects, for example, digital trace data can often be used to measure social relationships such as the network of European politicians pictured below.

-# Weaknesses of Digital Trace Data

-Despite the considerable advantages of digital trace data described above, they also create a range of challenges for empirical observation and causal inference.
-
-**Incomplete**

+<br><br>
 
-Though much is often made of the size and scale of digital trace data that can be collected, newcomers to the field are often surprised about the amount of data that are often missing or incomplete. Consider, for example, a study of bullying behavior on social media--- many of the most abusive posts that might be of interest to a researcher are often removed by Facebook before one might attempt to study them.

-**Inaccessible**
+### Inaccessible
 
 An even more formidable challenge is that data are often inaccessible. Though Twitter provides a massive amount of publicly available data, the vast majority of data generated on Facebook is private. Though some Facebook pages such as ""fan pages"" have default public settings, the vast majority of Facebook users set their default privacy settings in a manner that only allows people to access their data if they are affiliated with each other as ""friends.""

-**Non-Representative**
+### Non-Representative
 
 Another core challenge facing those who wish to work with digital trace data is that a random sample of Facebook or Twitter users is not representative of the broader population of the United States, or most other countries. The figure below presents some data from the Wall Street Journal on user demographics of several social media sites that demonstrates significant differences by platform according to race. On the other hand, usage of Facebook has become so widespread that some readers might be surprised to see how much more representative it has become of the U.S. public in recent years.

-**Drift**
+
+### Drifting
 
 MySpace was once the largest social media site in the world, according to some analysts. It is now resides in the graveyard of internet history like so many other websites. This raises the risk of ""drift"" in digital trace data-- platforms not only shift in their overall popularity (which of course has important implications for their representativeness), but also according to who uses them and why. Though Facebook was once the most popular platform for U.S. undergraduates, many have shifted to Instagram or Snapchat---possibly in reaction to the uptick of Facebook usage by their parents' generation :)

-**Algorithmic Counfounding**
 
-Sometimes, digital trace data that appear to describe human behavior actually reflect changes in the way humans interact with algorithms. One popular example of this is the ""parable of Google Flu."" Google Flu was once a popular tool that allowed users to estimate the prevalence of influenza using Google search data. The tool was so accurate that some suggested it should displace official surveys from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Yet in early 2013, Google estimates were far higher than those from the CDC. Researchers later discovered that estimates of influenza had been inflated by google advertising links about the flu that people were clicking on that had appeared in their web browsers after they searched for information about symptoms of the common cold. This is sometimes refered to as ""blue-team"" dynamics.

-**Unstructured**
+### Unstructured
 
 Digital Trace data are also often very messy. Newcomers to the field often assume that because data are generated in digital format that they are well structured, easily searchable, and quickly transposable across different formats. As we shall see in future tutorials, this is most often not true--- a recent New York Times article indicated that data scientists spend upwards of 80% of their time cleaning data!

-**Sensitive**
+### Sensitive
 
 Digital trace data are also often very sensitive. Recent events involving Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica Political Consulting Firm underscore the dangers of unfettered access to large troves of digital trace data, but there were many more---arguably more invasive---data breaches long before this recent event. One such incident, pictured below, involved European researchers who mined data from the internet dating site OK Cupid and then publicly released their data online.

-**Positivity-Bias**
+
+### Elite Bias
+
+You know the famous saying, ""history is written by the victors""? Much digital trace data is also created by people who are elites, and who might provide selective or incomplete accounts of what is going on, or worse.
+<br><br>
+
+![](books.jpg){width=400px}
+
+
+### Positivity-Bias
 
 Finally, digital trace data often have performative dimensions. Many people do not report negative information about themselves online precisely because they know that their friends, colleagues--- or other people they do not know--- may be watching them. This creates another common form of bias in social media research.

+## The Future of Digital Trace Data
 
-After reviewing so many of the negatives of digital trace data, you may be questioning whether its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I am overall optimistic about the future of digital trace data research because it is in its infancy. As Salganik (2016) writes, the field has recently experienced a Gartner hype cycle (see figure below). In my opinion, reaching the ""plateau of productivity"" will most likely require hybrid approaches that combine digital trace data analysis alongside more conventional modes of research such as survey analysis. I've written at length about this issue [elsewhere](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byvk0A8Ic21YMC1SNHIzWU5jSXc/view), and specifically the potential of using app technology to integrate digital trace data collection with survey research.

 Let's start with a toy example from the [video you've already watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLAi9v5CCnM). Imagine that you want to estimate the average height of Princeton students.  You collect a non-random sample of 60 students: 20 men and 40 women. Imagine that the men have average height of 180cm and the women have average height of 170cm. Further, imagine that we know that Princeton students are 50% women and 50% men. Given this information how should we estimate the average height of Princeton students?
 
-There are two natural approaches. The first--let's call it approach 1---would be to take the sample mean, which is 173.3 <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\left(\frac{180 \times 20+170 \times 40}{60}\right)"">.

 Approach 2 is cell-based post-stratification, and it can be generalized in many different ways.  One way that it can be generalized is that we can chop the population into any number of groups (not just men and women), produce an estimate for each group, and then combine the estimates based on the relative sizes of the groups.  For example, the [study by Wei Wang and colleagues](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.06.001) that used a non-random, opt-in sample from Xbox to predict the result of the 2012 election---described in [*Bit by Bit*](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/asking-questions/who/)---chopped the population into 76,256 groups defined by gender (2 categories), race (4 categories), age (4 categories), education (4 categories), state (51 categories), party ID (3 categories), ideology (3 categories), and 2008 vote (3 categories).  One challenge that arises as you chop the population into smaller and smaller groups is that you have less data from each group to make estimates.  For this reason, some researchers, such as Wang and colleagues, also use statistical modeling to produce the estimate for each group.  For this activity, we will not use modeling to the produce the estimate for each group because of time constraints.

 __Speakers:__ [Abdullah Almaatouq](http://www.amaatouq.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), [James Houghton](http://www.jamesphoughton.com/) (SICSS-Duke 20), and Nicolas Paton.
 
 __Description:__ [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) is a new open source software platform for developing and conducting synchronous and interactive human-subject experiments.  It has already been used by researchers around the world. This session will start with a live demonstration where participants will take part in a real-time experiment involving dozens of people.  Next, the data from that experiment will be downloaded and analyzed.  Thus, participants will have a behind-the-scenes, end-to-end experience with an experiment run with Emprica. Finally, there will be time for questions and discussion about Empirica and the future of experiments in the social sciences.

 __Moderator:__ Matthew Salganik
 
 __Description:__ Almost all computational social science depends on open source software, yet very few computational social scientists actually contribute to open source software.  These panelists will share their experiences developing open source software as part of an academic career, and they will offer advice for others who want to contribute to existing open source projects or start new ones.  There will be time for questions from the audience.

This has important implications because acquiring data to estimate causal effects accurately is often complicated and expensive, and results are often better when modeling intervention decisions rather than causal effects. He has also conducted work studying referrals in the ride-sharing industry; the interpretability of data-driven decions made by AI systems; and the combination of observational and experimental data to improve the intervention decisions made by machine learning models.""

 __Description:__ [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) is a new open source software platform for developing and conducting synchronous and interactive human-subject experiments.  It has already been used by researchers around the world. This session will start with a live demonstration where participants will take part in a real-time experiment involving dozens of people.  Next, the data from that experiment will be downloaded and analyzed.  Thus, participants will have a behind-the-scenes, end-to-end experience with an experiment run with Emprica. Finally, there will be time for questions and discussion about Empirica and the future of experiments in the social sciences.

 Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. About thirty participants will be invited. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

+At the moment we are still planning to hold BAY-SICSS 2020. And we are committed to doing so in a way that maximizes benefit to the community—that is a core part of our mission in developing and applying computational skills. It’s important to us to keep everyone involved safe in the environment of BAY-SICSS—which, it’s worth noting, is based around an immersive, hands-on model of learning. In other words, the actual gathering is an essential aspect of the institute.
+
+And as you know, news and suggestions about a public health response to the coronavirus--now including shelter-in-place orders--come out fast. Policies around social distancing and quarantining may become still more firm and widespread in coming days—but we have no way of knowing when we may reach “containment”, thus decreasing the need for distancing and allowing a transition back to normal social life. So we are following the lead of the main SICSS site (at Duke) and not making any stark decisions just now about whether or not to hold BAY-SICSS—and if so, in what capacity. Again, our priority is to keep everyone safe and contain the spread of the virus. To support this intention, we may change our approach in the coming weeks. 
+
+With that in mind, we encourage you to apply if you haven’t already. The application portal will remain open until we have a game plan for the likely scenario of this summer, which would allow us to conduct a full application review.

The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 
+**Updates** 
 
-The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics.

Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
+BAY-SICSS is going virtual! We are adapting our partner site from UC Berkeley campus to an online format, but will continue our thematic focus on computational social science in partnership with Bay Area nonprofits. We are working with SICSS-Duke, our partners, and guest speakers to balance flexibility with our goal of creating a community of community engaged scholars. 
 
-Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.
+The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, held concurrently with SICSS-Duke. In the second part of the institute, participants will co-develop a project with Bay Area nonprofits in health, criminal justice, and civil society.

+**Overview**
+
+From the evening of June 15 to July 3 2020, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley will co-host a partner event for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The San Francisco Bay Area Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (BAY-SICSS) will offer its first incarnation--and will be fully virtual!  
+
+BAY-SICSS has been generously supported by both Stanford University ([Institute for Research in the Social Sciences](https://iriss.stanford.edu/), [Human-Centered AI Initiative](https://hai.stanford.edu/), and [Arts and Sciences](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/)) and UC Berkeley ([Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) and [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)), and [Hopelab](https://hopelab.org/). BAY-SICSS is co-organized by [Nick Camp](https://ncamp.people.stanford.edu/), [Jaren Haber](https://www.jarenhaber.com/), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/), with [Sharad Goel](https://5harad.com/) and [David J. Harding](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-j-harding).
+The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science in the public interest: both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). BAY-SICSS is unique among partner locations in its focus on local community partnership, as reflected in our programming, participants, and partners. 
+
+Our instructional program involves lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, along with outside speakers conducting computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. During the second week, participants will co-develop a project with Bay Area nonprofits in health, criminal justice, and civil society. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). The co-organizers and principal faculty of the Summer Institute are Chris Bail and Matthew Salganik. 
+### Update: Because of COVID-19, SICSS-Duke 2020 will be switched from an in-person event to a virtual event.
 
-The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

+
+# Pre-arrival
+
+In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-Duke 2020. Our TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.
+
+## Videos
+
+SICSS-Duke 2020 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) where you will watch videos of lectures before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities. We expect to post about 10 hours worth of videos by May 15, 2020. If you'd like to have a sense of what these videos are like, you can watch our [lectures from 2019](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/curriculum).
+
+## Coding
+
+The majority of the coding work presented at the 2020 SICSS will employ R.  However, you are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists. If you would like to work in R, we recommend that you complete the free [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.  RStudio Primers cover 6 topics: The Basics, Working with Data, Visualize Data, Tidy Your Data, Iterate, and Write Functions.  If you already feel comfortable with these topics (either in R or some other language), then you do not need to complete these Primers.
+
+If you would like more practice after completing the RStudio Primers, some other materials that we can recommend are:
+- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
+- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
+- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.
+
+## Reading
+
+The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields, and therefore we think that asking you to do some reading before you arrive will help us use our time together more effectively.  In order to prepare for SICSS, you should read Matt’s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.
+
+## Computing environment
+
+Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support R.  You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them.
+
+Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  We will soon post a list of packages that we recommend as well.
+
+## Accounts
+
+- Slack: Before participating at SICSS-Duke 2020 you should have an account in the SICSS 2020 Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started[(https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started)] materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.
+
+- GitHub: Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate.  If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).  If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
+
+You may need to create accounts on other platforms as well.  If so, we will post that information here.
+
+## Office hours
+
+Our [TAs](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/duke/people#teaching_assistants) will host weekly office hours in the SICSS 2020 Slack.  You can find information about the office hours in the SICSS 2020 Slack channel #pre-office-hours.
+
+If you are not able to attend during the regularly scheduled office hours or have any questions about office hours, please contact Robin Lee, one of our [TAs](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/duke/people#teaching_assistants).

+**ATTENTION: SICSS-Howard-Mathematica has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19.**
+
+From the evening of Friday, June 12th to the morning of Saturday, June 27th, [Howard University](https://home.howard.edu/) and [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS). The theme of the SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 
+
+The interactive and instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, participant-led research projects, and career development enrichment activities. There will also be outside speakers who conduct and use computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
+
+Participation is open to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the session, including housing and most meals will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be accepted, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.
+
+The SICSS-Howard/Mathematica in Washington, D.C. is groundbreaking for a number of reasons. It will be the first Summer Institute held at a historically black college and university (HBCU). It also has the benefit of a deeply invested partner, Mathematica. Finally, SICSS-Howard/Mathematica will also have the benefit of a topical focus: Ethics and Equity in AI.

+#### SICSS-Howard/Mathematica Vision
+For SICSS-Howard/Mathematica we have an added purpose, to seed and grow a depth of knowledge and appreciation for computational social science in underrepresented communities.  SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is uniquely poised to highlight innovative methods to conduct social research on topics of pertinence to underrepresented communities using real-world data. Participants who share our drive to use computer science, data analytics, and evidence to improve public well-being within underrepresented communities will benefit from the opportunities and resources that are unique to SICSS-Howard/Mathematica given our presence at Howard University, the generous support and deep engagement of Mathematica, and our presence in the nation’s capital.
+
+#### Howard University
+Established in 1867, Howard University is a federally chartered, private, doctoral degree granting Historically Black 
+University. With an enrollment of over 9,000 students (3,000 of which are graduate students), it’s undergraduate, 
+graduate, professional, and joint degree programs span more than 120 areas of study within 13 schools and colleges. 
+The historic main campus sits on two hundred and fifty-six acres on a hilltop in Northwest Washington blocks from the 
+storied U Street and Howard Theatre and two miles from the U.S. Capitol. Howard University’s founding of 
+<i>SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI with Mathematica</i> is yet another way that Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding – an unwavering question to balance the scales for the 
+disenfranchised, and promote an American that is devoid of inequalities.  Howard has existed to address a plethora of 
+disparities that disproportionately affect the African-American population wherever it may occur.  AI presents a rapidly 
+evolving frontier where new voices are needed more than ever to promote <i>Veritas and Utilitias</i> (Truth and Service).
+
+“Howard University’s founding of SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI with Mathematica is yet another way that Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding—an unwavering question to balance the scales for the disenfranchised, and promote an America that is devoid of inequalities,” says Howard University President Wayne A. I. Frederick.
+
+#### Mathematica
+Founded in 1968, Mathematica reimagines the way the world gathers and uses data, surfacing evidence and insights that 
+illuminate the path to progress for public- and private-sector changemakers. Driven by our mission to improve public 
+well-being and our steadfast commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion, Mathematica’s nearly 1400 employees 
+collaborate closely with public- and private-sector partners to inform program and policy decisions in health, human services, 
+and international development. Throughout <i>SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI</i>, our data and public policy experts will work alongside participants to help translate big questions into deep insights that improve programs, refine strategies, and enhance equity.
+
+“This program provides aspiring researchers with insights to help them operate at the intersection of data science and social science, as well as surface new ways to apply an equity lens to that work—two topics that are poised to shape the future of public policy for years to come,” said [Paul Decker](https://www.mathematica.org/our-people/staff/paul-decker), president and CEO of Mathematica. “We are incredibly proud to stand with Howard University in shining a light on the importance of ethics and equity as artificial intelligence gains a foothold in more and more ways.”

+### Application - Frequently Asked Questions
+
+
+Can bachelor students also apply? Can associate or full professors also apply?
+
+No, unfortunately applications are only possible for Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 6 years of their (first) PhD.
+
+
+Can I also submit a writing sample written in German?
+
+If you are a Master or PhD student and can not yet provide an English writing sample, it is possible to submit a sample written in German. However, in this case you are required to provide an additional proof of English proficiency appended to one of your application files. This must not necessarily be a certificate from a language test. For instance, you can also provide a statement about a considerable amount of time spent in an English speaking country.
+
+
+Filling out the form requires a google account. Can I rather submit my application elsewhere?
+
+It is only possible to submit your application via the form linked above. However, it does not matter which google account you use to fill out the form. No data associated with the account are relevant for the application. If you nevertheless feel uncomfortable about uploading files, you can instead provide (working!) links to external sources. As an example, instead of uploading your C.V. in the form, you could upload a file including a link to your C.V. file stored elsewhere.

+From June 14 to June 26, the Maastricht Law & Tech Lab will be hosting the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science Maastricht (SICSS-Maastricht). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. SICSS-Maastricht is for legal researchers, social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). SICSS-Maastricht is unique among partner locations in its <b> focus on legal data, both from the perspective of collection as well as analysis </b>. Throughout the duration of the Institute in Maastricht, <b>we will explore how computational methods can be applied to legal research questions</b>. 
 
 The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
 
-Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

+As we discussed in our call for applications, we have arranged two types of training prior to the event this summer. Some students have more sophisticated coding skills but little exposure to social science; other students have significant exposure to social science but lack strong coding skills.
+
+## Coding
+
+The majority of the coding work presented at the 2020 SICSS will employ R.  However, you are welcome to employ a language of your choice- such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists. If you would like to work in R, we recommend that you complete the following courses within [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), a website that teaches people how to code.  Obviously, you only need to complete the classes with material that you would like to learn.

+
+## Reading List
+
+Our institute will bring together people from many fields, and therefore we think that asking you to do some reading before you arrive will help us use our time together more effectively.  First, we ask you to read Matt's book, [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com), which is a broad introduction to computational social science. Parts of this book will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.
+
+Also, for students with little or no exposure to sociology, economics, or political science, we have assembled a collection of exemplary papers in the core areas addressed by the Russell Sage Foundation. Neither your work nor the work we develop together at the institute need map neatly onto these categories, but if those with less exposure to social science read these, we will increase the chances of interdisciplinary cross-pollination, which we view as critical to the future of computational social science.

+From the evening of June 14 to 19, 2020, the [Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu/) will host a partner site for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. 
+
+The Princeton-CITP Summer Institute is unique among partner locations in its target population: individuals who work in government interested in using computational social science to improve the agencies and communities they serve.
+ 
+The instructional program will involve lectures, group activities, and participant-led information exchange and problem solving. There will also be guest speakers from institutions and organizations who conduct computational social science research in a variety of policy-relevant settings. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, machine learning, network analysis, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and work with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.
+
+Participation is restricted to individuals working in government. Applicants should be currently in or transitioning to roles in which they use data to solve policy problems or improve public administration. Applicants should have some training in or job-related experience with datasets and using statistical tools. 
+
+Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, levels of government, and geographic areas, especially applicants from groups under-represented in computational social science and public service. About fifteen participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program held at Princeton University. 
+
+In addition to the SICSS core sponsors, the Princeton-CITP partner event is supported by the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy and the Data Driven Social Science Initiative. 
+
+[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/princeton/apply) are due **April 5, 2020**. Inquiries may be sent to sicsscitp@gmail.com.

-From XXXX to XXXX, the XXXX will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at XXXXXX. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 
+From January 3 to January 9 of 2021, the SICSS core sponsors and the University of Arizona will sponsor the first Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, a partner site for SICSS. The purpose of the event is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty interested in computational social science. The event is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).
 
-The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
+The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects.

To expand her research experience in health services research and to continue her passion for teaching she took up a post-doctoral fellow position at the Center for Minority Health Services Research (CMHSR) in the college of pharmacy. There she was involved in consulting on research methodology and conducting statistical evaluation for CMHSR projects involving analysis of large secondary data. Her projects involved evaluating and analyzing national health care surveys, electronic medical claims, and electronic medical records. Her passion for research and teaching continued and in 2011 she accepted a faculty position as an assistant professor at the Howard University College of Pharmacy. Since then she has worked and collaborated with clinical faculty on various patient and student projects. Her current areas of interest include medication use in pregnancy, women's health issues, minority health issues, medication adherence, drug safety, global pharmacovigilance and pharmacy education. Her work as a research fellow at CMHSR continues where she supports the design and evaluation of faculty, resident and student projects. She also continues to lead efforts to revitalize funding, collaboration and infrastructure at CMHSR. More recently she facilitated a collaborative effort to compete for a workforce diversity grant through the Office of Minority Health. Through its success the Howard University National Workforce Diversity Pipeline (HU-NWDP) project was initiated at the College. Mary Maneno now serves as the co-director for the HU-NWDP project. On a personal level Mary considers herself a proud alumni of Howard and remains committed to seeking opportunities to advance its mission through her efforts at the College of Pharmacy.""

+  bio: ""Alejandro Beltran is a PhD candidate at the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. His research broadly explores corruption and violence in Mexico. In his dissertation he identifies the institutional and political determinants of corruption investigations performed by subnational audit agencies. A separate research agenda explores the diversification of drug trafficking organizations into fentanyl and its consequences on violence. As a computational social scientist, he uses machine learning and natural language processing to generate quantitative measures of these phenomena and implements methods for causal inference in his empirical work.""

BAY-SICSS is co-organized by [Nick Camp](https://ncamp.people.stanford.edu/), [Jaren Haber](https://www.jarenhaber.com/), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/), with [Sharad Goel](https://5harad.com/) and [David J. Harding](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-j-harding).
 The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science in the public interest: both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). BAY-SICSS is unique among partner locations in its focus on local community partnership, as reflected in our programming, participants, and partners.

 Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program held at UC Berkeley.

Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. Participants with little or no exposure to sociology, economics, or political science, will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute. Most of the coding work presented at SICSS Konstanz will employ the R programming language. Participants with less coding experience will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules for R.

+From the evening of June 14 to June 26, the University of Copenhagen will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science sponsored by [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.ku.dk) and the [Centre for Social Data Science](https://sodas.ku.dk/). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is open to both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 
 
 The instructional program will involve lectures and group problem sets during the first week, and the opportunity for participant-led research projects in week two. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered in coordination with the Duke University site include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

 The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.
 
 We invite applications not only from participants with a background in both computational methods and social science, but especially from those who seek to acquire new skills in either of these domains. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

 ### Hosting a partner location
 
-Starting in 2018, the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) began including partner locations in order to increase the number of participants. The Summer Institute is two weeks long and parter locations typically involve: 1) live-streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; 2) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; 3) live-streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and 4) participant-led group research projects. This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.

The Summer Institute is two weeks long and partner locations typically involve: 1) live-streamed lectures on topics ranging from automated text analysis to ethics; 2) training exercises to reinforce key ideas from lectures; 3) live-streamed research talks from leaders in the field; and 4) participant-led group research projects. This model has been used successfully at universities and companies around the world.
 
 The Summer Institutes are highly modular and the open source curriculum can be adapted to the skills and interests at each location. The minimum budget to support a partner location is about $15,000 but depends on local conditions. Here are some [sample budgets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2BimdmWNLSVYqTmwrEZcQxv3j3LCyU0hQyW0vZYCk8/edit?usp=sharing). If you have more questions about budgeting—or grants that may be available to support partner locations—please contact us at rsfcompsocsci@gmail.com.
             
-In order to ensure quality and consistency, all partner locations must have a former participant of SICSS as one of the local organizers. If you don’t have any SICSS alumni at your organization, you can contact us about finding a former participant that could collaborate with you. For example, in 2019 Matti Nelimarkka (SICSS ‘17) collaborated with Akın Ünver to run a partner location in [Istanbul, Turkey](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/istanbul/)(Kadir Has University).

About thirty participants will be invited.
 
 The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

 ## Limitations of Topic Models
 
 Topic models have become a standard tool within quantitative text analysis for many different reasons. Topic models can be much more useful than simple word frequency or dictionary based approaches depending upon the use case. Topic models tend to produce the best results when applied to texts that are not too short (such as tweets), and those that have a consistent structure. "

   bio: ""Sharon Meraz’s work resides in the interplay of political communication, networked journalism, social networks, and mass media theory. As a scholar centrally interested in political activism and political engagement online, she explores how mass media effect theories take shape and evolve due to the growth of networked, social media technologies that empower political publics. In bringing a social network analytic perspective to the evolving media ecology, she has explored such new theoretical premises as networked gatekeeping, networked framing, network agenda setting, memetics, and virality. Meraz is also interested in automated content analysis, natural language processing, and social network visualization of big data. Her work has explored political activity and activism networks in such social applications as blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and online political forums during electoral cycles, disaster times, and social movements. Meraz is an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Department of Communication. She also serves on several diversity committees and initiatives at the university, including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) and Fellowship Committees for Minority Students. """

   bio: ""Sharon Meraz’s work resides in the interplay of political communication, networked journalism, social networks, and mass media theory. As a scholar centrally interested in political activism and political engagement online, she explores how mass media effect theories take shape and evolve due to the growth of networked, social media technologies that empower political publics. In bringing a social network analytic perspective to the evolving media ecology, she has explored such new theoretical premises as networked gatekeeping, networked framing, network agenda setting, memetics, and virality. Meraz is also interested in automated content analysis, natural language processing, and social network visualization of big data. Her work has explored political activity and activism networks in such social applications as blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and online political forums during electoral cycles, disaster times, and social movements. Meraz is an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Department of Communication. She also serves on several diversity committees and initiatives at the university, including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) and Fellowship Committees for Minority Students. ""

-In the process, we will gain experience with writing survey questionnaires, creating surveys on Google Forms, publishing surveys on MTurk, data wrangling, implementing various weighting methods, documenting surveys for dissemination, and thinking about broader issues related to survey errors and data quality.  Please read the entire activity before beginning.

 Though network analysis is most often used to describe relationships between people, some of the early pioneers of network analysis realized that it could also be applied to represent relationships between words. For example, one can represent a corpus of documents as a network where each node is a document, and the thickness or strength of the edges between them describes similarities between the words used in any two documents. Or, one can create a textnetwork where individual words are the nodes, and the edges between them describe the regularity with which they co-occur in documents.
 
-There are multiple advantages to a network-based approach to automated text analysis. Just as clusters of social connections can help explain a range of outcomes, understanding patterns of connections between words helps identify their meaning in a more precise manner than the ""bag of words"" approaches discussed in earlier tutorials. Second, text networks can be built out of documents of any length, whereas topic models function poorly on short texts such as social media messages. Finally, there are an arguably more sophisticated set of techniques for identifying clusters within social networks than those employed in other automated text analysis techniques described in my earlier tutorials.

 This study was somewhat more involved than the Munger study (and also much more expensive) since it combined not only observation of publicly-available Twitter data, but also linked these data to surveys of a large group of people. The bots were also somewhat more sophisticated in that they were created using a variety of sophisticated tools from social network analysis and the field of natural language processing. Still, these bots were not terribly difficult to create, and I describe the steps needed to create a bot such as ours in the following section.
 
-#How to Create a Bot
+# How to Create a Bot
 
-One way to create a bot is to write a .R script that is hosted on a single computer and runs throughout the study period. Yet such a strategy presents numerous obstacles. First, it ties up the R session on a machine and it therefore cannot be used for other routine work. Users have to either have another computer or a lot of time on their hands. Second, bots that are hosted on a single laptop or desktop can typically only be accessed or controlled from that machine. Third, all machines are prone to failure, and if the machine that hosts the app fails, valuable time can go buy during a field experiment before the researcher becomes aware of the failure.
+One way to create a bot is to write a .R script that is hosted on a single computer and runs throughout the study period. Yet such a strategy presents numerous obstacles. First, it ties up the R session on a machine and it therefore cannot be used for other routine work. Users have to either have another computer or a lot of time on their hands. It is possible for users to run multiple R sessions on a single machine, and activity within each R session should not interfere with other active sessions. However, multiple R sessions may not be appropriate if activity within one or more R sessions proves too computationally intensive.  Second, bots that are hosted on a single laptop or desktop can typically only be accessed or controlled from that machine. Third, all machines are prone to failure, and if the machine that hosts the app fails, valuable time can go by during a field experiment before the researcher becomes aware of the failure.
 
-For these reasons, I host the bots I've built in my work on a cloud machine running Rstudio via an Amazon EC2 server. This may sound complicated, but it is actually rather straightforward. The first step is to create an ""Amazon Web Services"" account. If you are a student, you may be eligible for 750 hours of free computing time. If you are not a student, you may be pleased to see that cloud computing time can be purchased quite inexpensively---particularly if you do not require significant computing power. The second step is to find a ""Machine image"" that will provide Amazon with instructions about how to create a cloud machine that can run RStudio. There are now many of these available, but one of the more popular ones is [Louis Aslet's](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/). Click on the ""region"" closest to you to minimize latency (the time with which it takes for instructions to move from your location to the location of the Amazon server farm). You will also need to follow additional instructions on the aforementioned website in order to configure a ""security group"" and open up incoming HTTP traffic via port 80. You then cut and paste the ""Public IP or DNS"" address from your Amazon EC2 page into your web browser and you will be redirected to an Rstudio log-in page. By default, your user name and password are set to ""Rstudio,"" but you can change these immediately after loggin in (which is good practice to create additional security and prevent others from using your cloud machine). **Keep in mind that as long as your machine is on or running, you will be charged by the hour, so make sure to shut down your cloud machines once you are done using them.**

 Regardless of where you host your bot, you will need to write some code to make it perform the functions necessary for your study. Below, I present code for a very primitive example of a bot that retweets a message about computational social science each hour for 24 days. 
 
@@ -92,9 +92,9 @@ Needless to say, bots can be much more sophisticated-- writing code to make bots
 Most studies will also require data collection of those whom the bot interacts with. Such data can be collected within the bot code, or in a separate script that monitors accounts that are selected for interaction by a bot. Once again, make sure your bot does not conflict with Twitter's terms of service, and does not abuse rate limits.
 
 
-#Ethical Issues in App and Bot-Based Research
+# Ethical Issues in App and Bot-Based Research
 
-Ethical issues in app and bot-based research are manifold and IRB guidelines for such research are in their infancy. For these reasons, it is vital--- in my view---that computational social scientists hold themselves to a standard that is higher than IRB because there will no doubt be ethical issues on the horizons that we do not yet know exist. The Cambridge Analytica scandal may only be the tip of the ice-berg in terms of the potential for data collected by apps to be repurposed or merged with other datasets for other purposes. Such issues, combined with the perrenial issue of data security and the challenge of maintaining confidentiality with increasingly detailed data-- or meta data--should inspire researchers to carefully review their plans not only with the IRB, but also with other members of the computational social science community who can help them ensure that their research is ethical and safe.

 <h2><strong>What is Screen-Scraping?</strong></h2>
 <p>Screenscraping refers to the process of automatically extracting data from web pages, and often a long list of websites that cannot be mined by hand. As the figure below illustrates, a typical screenscraping program a) loads the name of a web-page to be scraped from a list of webpages; b) downloads the website in a format such as HTML or XML; c) finds some piece of information desired by the author of the code; and d) places that information in a convenient format such as a “data frame” (which is R speak for a dataset). Screenscraping can also be used to download other types of content as well, however, such as audio-visual content. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge about R and other skills described in previous tutorials at the link above.</p>

 <p>As the output above shows, I now finally have the data I wanted in the form of a data frame or dataset called “health_rankings.” This was quite a bit of work, however, and recall that this was a very simple type of webpage. Also, it is worth noting that groups of Wikipedia pages have a very similar format which makes them very amenable to screen-scraping. If, on the other hand, I was scraping a list of sites from multiple domains– each of which have their own complicated structure— I could spend days or weeks writing code to scrape them. In this scenario, many people may find that it is easier to collect the data by hand, or hire workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to extract the information you might want from a list of web pages.</p>
 <p>One final note: often the web page that you wish to scrape will contain XML instead of HTML (or in addition to HTML). In this case, the <code>rvest</code> package has a series of functions to parse XML such as <code>xml</code> and <code>xml_node</code>.</p>

-Challenges of Building Apps for Social Science Research
-========================================================
-&nbsp;
-
-1. Significant coding skills required (html, css, cloud-computing, reactive programming)  
-
-2. Competitive environment for attention (apps are no longer ""new"")
-
-3. Concerns about data sharing/privacy  
-
-4. Compelling incentives are hard to identify- and particularly challenging for studies of sensitive topics. But financial incentives may be an important option going forward. 
-
-
-Ok, but how do I build an App?
-========================================================
-
-
-Shiny
-========================================================
-
-Shiny is a (relatively) new tool that enables people to build, compile, and host interactive apps natively within RStudio

-Three Components of A Shiny App
-========================================================
-&nbsp;
-
-Global.R  
-server.R  
-ui.R  
-
-Global.R
-========================================================
-&nbsp;
-
--The ""memory"" of the app. Stores things you want to call from other parts of the app (usually data but could also be functions and other types of objects)
-
-server.R
-========================================================
-&nbsp;
-
--The ""brains"" of the app- runs the analysis you want to show the user, but can also store data generated by the user, or expose different users to different types of information (good for experimentation)
-
-ui.R
-========================================================
-&nbsp;
-
--The ""face"" of the app. Determines what user will see (e.g. what types of visualizations, check boxes or word boxes, fonts, etc.) Can load fancy images, logos, etc. to improve the overall appeal of the app.

   bio: ""Muyang Li is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at University at Albany, SUNY. She holds a BA in Communication from the Communication University of China and an MSc in New Media from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her research is organized around a key question: how does media interact with democracy and social justice. Her research is interdisciplinary in scope, which relies on methodological and theoretical frameworks across disciplines and fields, including sociology, communication, cultural studies, political science, and computer/information technology. Given these interests and her interdisciplinary background, Muyang’s dissertation applies mixed-method in exploring the negotiation between the authoritarian state and the individual in defining democracy through the social media, and try to reveal how the authoritarian regimes survived the ideological crisis in the social media era through the combination of repressive and hegemonic media control strategies.""

   bio: ""Amanda Lu is a PhD Student in Education Policy at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Her research focuses on how school choice policies and markets shape the educational experiences of students in traditionally underserved communities and is informed by economics, sociology, and political science. It seeks to understand how school choice changes political participation and facilitates the rise of new power structures and organizations in urban school systems. Before graduate school, Amanda was a high school teacher in New Orleans, LA where she taught high school math and served as the college counselor at Edna Karr High School. She earned a joint masters in Policy, Organization, and Leadership Studies from the Stanford GSE and MPP from the Stanford Public Policy Program in 2017, and a bachelor’s degree in Government from Harvard College in 2011.""

   bio: ""Sharon Meraz’s work resides in the interplay of political communication, networked journalism, social networks, and mass media theory. As a scholar centrally interested in political activism and political engagement online, she explores how mass media effect theories take shape and evolve due to the growth of networked, social media technologies that empower political publics. In bringing a social network analytic perspective to the evolving media ecology, she has explored such new theoretical premises as networked gatekeeping, networked framing, network agenda setting, memetics, and virality. Meraz is also interested in automated content analysis, natural language processing, and social network visualization of big data. Her work has explored political activity and activism networks in such social applications as blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and online political forums during electoral cycles, disaster times, and social movements. Meraz is an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Department of Communication. She also serves on several diversity committees and initiatives at the university, including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) and Fellowship Committees for Minority Students. ""

 ### Eligibility
 
 Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D.  However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. About thirty participants will be invited.  
 
-The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational soical scientists across all levels of technical experience.  Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language.  Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.
 
 We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.
 
 ### How to Apply
 
-Our application system is not yet accepting materials.  But, once it is enabled, all applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (especially as it relates to RSF research priorities such as behavioral economics, social inequality, future of work, and immigration), (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author.  Applicants who are graduate students or postdoctoral researchers must submit two letters of recommendation from faculty advisors. Letters of recommendation should be as informative as possible about your standing in your program, general ability, research potential, and (if applicable) special interest in computational social science.  All applications must include an e-mail and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number).

 The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and student-led research projects.  There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government.  Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics.  There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers.  Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.
