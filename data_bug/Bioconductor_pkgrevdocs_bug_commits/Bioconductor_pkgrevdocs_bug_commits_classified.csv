+### Bug fixes due to API changes {#bug-fixes-due-to-api-changes}
+
+Packages that make use of web APIs will need to be updated when there are
+significant API changes. This is a common occurrence with Bioconductor packages
+that use REST APIs, e.g., `UniProt.ws`, `AnVIL`, etc. To provide a smooth
+experience for users, it is important to update the package as soon as possible.
+
+#### Minor API changes
+
+The steps to apply bug fixes due to API changes are similar to the steps for
+fixing bugs in the `devel` and `release` branches. The main difference is that
+the bug may be due to minor API issues, certificate issues, API version issues,
+etc. The maintainer can readily update the R package to adapt to the new API.
+Note that the functionality of the package largely remains the same.
+
+#### Major API changes
+
+It may be possible that an organization's API changes are not backwards
+compatible and that they do not provide the same functionality for the existing
+Bioconductor package to remain functional. In such case, it is recommended to
+contact the organization that maintains the API to get more information about
+the changes and to request a backward compatible API, if possible. When API
+changes do not provide a similar functionality to that of the R package, the
+package maintainer may need to submit a new package that works with the new API
+and to deprecate the old package.

+
+For typical setup scenarios, see the [tidyverse blog
+post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/).
 
 ## What do I need to change?
 
-Bioconductor developers will have to rename default branches on their
-repositories to 'devel'. This includes GitHub and other local copies of their
-repositories including those from collaborators.
+We recommend Bioconductor developers to rename default branches on their
+__local__ repositories to 'devel'. Optionally (and highly encouraged), GitHub
+and other local copies of affected repositories, including those from
+collaborators, should have their branches renamed.
 
 Bioconductor users will not need to do anything.
 
+**Note**. The minority of maintainers _without_ a GitHub repository should
+rename and set the 'HEAD' as follows:
+
+    git branch -m master devel
+    git fetch origin
+    git branch -u origin/devel devel
+    git remote set-head origin -a
+
+All other maintainers with GitHub repositories should see the sections [How do
+I set 'devel' as the default branch on
+GitHub?](#how-do-i-set-devel-as-the-default-branch-on-github) and [How do I set
+'devel' as the default local
+'branch?](#how-do-i-set-devel-as-the-default-local-branch), respectively.
+
+## What if I am an RStudio user?
+
+Maintainers that use RStudio should be familiar with running `git` commands
+via the `Terminal` tab in RStudio. The commands shown in this documentation
+can be entered in the `Terminal` tab, e.g., `git fetch --all` to obtain all
+updates from available remotes.
+
+## What if I create a fresh clone of my repository?
+
+It is possible to create a fresh clone of the repository but you may lose
+any working changes in the old local repository. This should only be done if
+you are comfortable with `git` and would like to start afresh. You will also
+need to set up the git remotes as
+[below](#what-should-my-git-remotes-look-like).
+
 ## What should my Git remotes look like?
 
-A recommended `git remote` set up should have `origin` set to the GitHub
-location and `upstream` to the Bioconductor git repository. For example,
-this would be the set up for `BiocGenerics`:
+As a reminder, maintainers who use GitHub should have the following recommended
+setup. The command `git remote -v` should display an `origin` remote that points
+to the GitHub location and an `upstream` remote that points to the Bioconductor
+git repository. For example, this is the set up for `BiocGenerics`:
 
     git remote -v
     # origin	git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (fetch)
     # origin	git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (push)
     # upstream	git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (fetch)
     # upstream	git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (push)
     
-Note that we are using the SSH protocol for both remotes.
+__Note__. As maintainers, we use the SSH protocol for both remotes.
 
 ## How do I sync my Git remotes?
 
-Before making updates to branches, make sure that both remotes `origin` and
-`upstream` are in sync with:
+Before making updates to local branches, make sure that both remotes `origin`
+and `upstream` are in sync with:
 
     git checkout master
     git pull origin master
     git pull upstream devel:master
+    
+__Note__. These commands are to be run on the old local repository and do not
+apply to freshly cloned repositories.
+
+## How do I set 'devel' as the default branch on GitHub?
+
+For maintainers who manage GitHub repositories and would like to use streamlined
+commands, we recommend synchronizing the default branch changes to their GitHub
+repositories. To this end, GitHub has provided a convenient way to rename the
+default branch of any repository. First, go to
+`https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/branches` where
+`username` and `repo` correspond to your GitHub username and repository,
+respectively.
+
+Then, click on the 'edit' pencil `r emo::ji(""pen"")` to rename the branch (seen
+here at the bottom right corner) and rename the branch to 'devel':
+
+```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width = ""100%""}
+knitr::include_graphics(""images/rename_branch_github_screen.png"")
+```
+
+That's it! The default branch on GitHub is now set to `devel`.
+
+Follow the instructions in the [How do I set 'devel' as the default local
+branch?](#how-do-i-set-devel-as-the-default-local-branch) to sync local
+repository clones.
+
+## What if I already have a 'devel' branch on GitHub?
+
+Simply select the ""switch default branch"" button (which looks like exchange
+arrows `r emo::ji(""arrows_counterclockwise"")`) at the top right of the ""Default
+branch"" box when navigating to `https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/branches`
+where `username` and `repo` correspond to your GitHub username and repository,
+respectively.
 
 ## How do I set 'devel' as the default local branch?
 
-The recommended way to use `devel` as the default branch is to carry out the
-rename operation on GitHub _first_ then perform an adjustment of the local
-branch(es).
+In order to keep commands simple and avoid confusion, we recommend making the
+same default branch changes to the GitHub repository. This allows minimal
+commands such as
 
-Once the branch is renamed, use the GitHub commands to update the local copy of
-the repository:
+    git push origin
+    git push upstream

+to simply work without specifying additional parameters, (e.g., `main:devel`)
+when pushing to GitHub and Bioconductor.
+
+For maintainers who wish to make changes on GitHub as well, we recommend
+performing the rename operation on
+[GitHub _first_](#how-do-i-set-devel-as-the-default-branch-on-github), then
+performing an adjustment (rename) of the local branch(es).
+
+__Note__. This step is not necessary if you cloned a fresh copy from the
+Bioconductor git server though you will have to re-specify the `origin` and
+`upstream` remotes (as described [above](#what-should-my-git-remotes-look-like))
+with a fresh copy.
+
+Once the branch is renamed on GitHub, use the GitHub-provided commands to update
+the local copy of the repository:

+     > if (x) 1
+     Error in if (x) 1 : the condition has length > 1
+
+<b>Solution:</b>
+In most cases this is a misjudgment in the length of the argument rather than
+intentional use of checking if the value was assigned.  The code should be reviewed
+to see if argument is being assigned correctly.  In most cases the simple
+solution might be to use an `any( )` or `all( )` surrounding the vector.

+#### System Requirement missing in the Bioconductor Build System
+
+Your package may fail to build or check in the Bioconductor Build System (BBS)
+because your package or some of its dependencies have a *System Requirement* not
+available in the BBS.
+
+For instance, the first Bioconductor package that suggested the installation of
+the [`archive`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/archive/index.html)
+CRAN package, could not pass the checks at the BBS. The build report stated that
+""the archive package could not be found"", however the package had been present
+in CRAN for months. The `archive` package reports among its system requirements
+the `libarchive` library, and the BBS did not have that library installed.
+
+If you happen to miss a system dependency in the BBS, please open an issue similar
+to [BBS issue #220](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BBS/issues/220), where you
+mention which is the Bioconductor package that either directly or indirectly
+has a system requirement, and if possible provide information on the missing
+package that would need to be installed. If you follow the pull requests related
+to that issue, you will see that the solution was the installation of the

+# Deprecation Guidelines {#deprecation}
+
+In the normal course of software development, functions, classes, methods, or
+data objects may need to be removed. Here are some guidelines for ensuring
+that this process is minimally disruptive to your users.
+
+## What to Deprecate?
+
+Any function, class, method, or data that is no longer used or needed.
+
+## When to Follow These Guidelines?
+
+If you introduce a function into the devel branch of your package,
+then soon after decide not to use it, you may simply remove the function
+without following these guidelines. It is expected that the devel
+branch is unstable and subject to API changes without notice (though
+you may decide to communicate these changes to your users via the
+Bioconductor [support site][]).
+
+However, if a function has existed in at least one released version
+of Bioconductor, these guidelines _must_ be followed. The process of removing
+a funciton, class, method, or any exported package object takes approximately
+three release cycles (about 18 months).
+
+## How To Deprecate A Function {#deprecate-function}
+
+### Step 1: Deprecate the function
+
+When you first decide to eliminate a function, you should mark it as
+deprecated in the devel branch. Do this by calling <code>.Deprecated()</code>
+inside the function. To do this, you must provide a replacement function
+which should be used in place of the old function. Example:
+
+    myOldFunc <- function()
+    {
+        .Deprecated(""myNewFunc"")
+        ## use new function, or remainder of myOldFunc
+    }
+
+This causes a warning to be emitted whenever a user calls
+<code>myOldFunc()</code>. See <code>?.Deprecated</code> for more information.
+
+Indicate in the man page of the old function that it has been
+deprecated, and suggest a replacement function. Be sure the old
+function is not called in man page examples or vignette code chunks; R
+CMD check should report this.
+
+    \name{MyPkg-deprecated}
+    \alias{MyPkg-deprecated}
+    \title{Deprecated functions in package \sQuote{MyPkg}}
+
+    \description{
+      These functions are provided for compatibility with older versions
+      of \sQuote{MyPkg} only, and will be defunct at the next release.
+    }
+
+    \details{
+
+      The following functions are deprecated and will be made defunct; use
+      the replacement indicated below:
+      \itemize{
+
+        \item{myOldFunc: \code{\link{newFunc}}}
+
+      }
+    }
+
+### Step 2: Mark the function as defunct
+
+In the next release cycle, after your function has been deprecated, it
+must be made defunct in the devel branch.  This means a call to the
+old function will return an informative error but not run any
+additional code. Example:
+
+    myOldFunc <- function()
+    {
+        .Defunct(""myNewFunc"")
+    }
+
+See <code>?Defunct</code> for more information.
+
+Remove the documentation of the defunct function, and add to a man
+page such as the following:
+
+    \name{MyPkg-defunct}
+    \alias{myOldFunc}
+    \title{Defunct functions in package \sQuote{pkg}}
+    \description{These functions are defunct and no longer available.}
+
+    \details{
+      Defunct functions are: \code{myOldFunc}
+    }
+
+### Step 3: Remove the function
+
+In the next release cycle, after your function has been marked as defunct,
+remove it entirely from your package R code and NAMESPACE in the devel
+branch. Also remove any man page content that documents the function.
+
+Leave the man page from the previous step in place so that
+
+    help(""MyPkg-defunct"")
+
+still shows the list of defunct functions and their appropriate replacements.
+
+## How To Deprecate A Package Dataset {#deprecate-dataset}
+
+### Step 1 - Save a promise object
+
+The initial step of deprecating a dataset is to signal to any users on
+the devel branch of Bioconductor that the dataset will no longer be used.
+This can be done using a `warning` message when the devel user loads
+the dataset. In order to do this, we first create a promise object with
+the same name as the dataset name using the `delayedAssign` function:
+
+    delayedAssign(
+        x = ""pkgDataset"",
+        value = {
+            warning(""'pkgDataset' dataset is deprecated; see '?newData'"")
+            pkgDataset
+        }
+    )
+
+You can also include the dataset as an output after the warning.
+We then replace the original `.Rda` dataset file in the package with the
+promise object and dataset using the `save` function:
+
+    save(""pkgDataset"", eval.promises = FALSE, file = ""data/pkgDataset.Rda"")
+
+With the `eval.promises` argument set to `FALSE`, we can delay the evaluation
+of the promise object until the user loads the data with
+`data(""pkgDataset"", package = ""yourPkg"")`. The user will then get a warning
+along with the dataset. The warning should include instructions that will point
+the user to a new dataset or functionality that will replace the data, if
+necessary.
+
+### Step 2 - Update documentation
+
+After the promise object has been saved, we update the documentation to
+reflect the changes and provide additional details and resources for
+users as necessary. It is recommended to include a ""&#91;Deprecated&#93;"" label in the
+data documentation title.
+
+### Step 3 - Defunct the dataset
+
+In the following release cycle, you can update the warning message to indicate
+that the dataset is defunct and remove it entirely from the promise object
+i.e., from the expression in the `delayedAssign` function. We can also update
+the ""&#91;Deprecated&#93;"" label in the documentation title to ""&#91;Defunct&#93;"".

-  The  code chunk starts with a line `<<>>=`, and ends with `@`.
-  Each chunk is evaluated during `R CMD build`, prior to $\LaTeX$ compilation to a PDF document.
-* An *R markdown* vignette is similar to a *Sweave* vignette, but uses [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) instead of $\LaTeX$ for structuring text sections and resulting in HTML output.
-  The `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg(""knitr"")` package can process most *Sweave* and all *R markdown* vignettes, producing pleasing output.
-  Refer to [Writing package vignettes](http://cran.fhcrc.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-package-vignettes) for technical details.
-  See the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""BiocStyle"")` package for a convenient way to use common macros and a standard style.
-
-A vignette provides reproducibility: the vignette produces the same results as copying the corresponding commands into an <i class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> session.
-It is therefore **essential** that the vignette embed executed <i class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> code.
-Shortcuts (e.g., using a $\LaTeX$ verbatim environment, or using the *Sweave* `eval=FALSE` flag, or equivalent tricks in markdown) undermine the benefit of vignettes and are generally **not allowed**; exceptions can be made with proper justification and are at the discretion of [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) reviewers.
-
-All packages are required to have at least one Rmd or Rnw vignette.
-Vignettes go in the `vignettes/` directory of the package.

+## Vignettes {#vignettes}
+
+A vignette demonstrates how to accomplish non-trivial tasks embodying the core
+functionality of your package. There are two common types of vignettes.
+
+* A *Sweave* vignette is an `.Rnw` file that contains $\LaTeX$ and chunks of <i
+  class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> code. The  code chunk starts with a line
+  `<<>>=`, and ends with `@`. Each chunk is evaluated during `R CMD build`,
+  prior to $\LaTeX$ compilation to a PDF document.
+  
+* An *R markdown* vignette is similar to a *Sweave* vignette, but uses
+  [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) instead of $\LaTeX$
+  for structuring text sections and resulting in HTML output. The `r
+  BiocStyle::CRANpkg(""knitr"")` package can process most *Sweave* and all *R
+  markdown* vignettes, producing pleasing output. Refer to [Writing package
+  vignettes][CRAN vigs] for technical details. See the `r
+  BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""BiocStyle"")` package for a convenient way to use common
+  macros and a standard _Bioconductor_ style vignette.
+  
+A vignette provides reproducibility: the vignette produces the same results as
+copying the corresponding commands into an <i class=""fab fa-r-project""></i>
+session. It is therefore **essential** that the vignette embed executed <i
+class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> code. Shortcuts (e.g., using a $\LaTeX$ verbatim
+environment, or using the *Sweave* `eval=FALSE` flag, or equivalent tricks in
+markdown) undermine the benefit of vignettes and are generally **not allowed**;
+exceptions can be made with proper justification and are at the discretion of
+[_Bioconductor_ reviewers][reviewer-list].
+
+All packages are required to have at least one Rmd or Rnw vignette. Vignettes go
+in the `vignettes/` directory of the package. Vignettes are often used as
+standalone documents, so best practices are to include an informative title, the
+primary author of the vignette, the last modification date of the vignette, and
+a link to the package landing page. We encourage the use of `r
+BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""BiocStyle"")` for formatting.
+
+Some best practices for writing _Bioconductor_ vignettes are detailed in the
+following sections.
 
 ### Introduction
 
-Add an ""Introduction"" section that serves as an abstract to introduce the objective, models, unique functions, key points, etc that distinguish the package from other packages in the same area.

+### Resolve Duplicate Commits
+
+__Goal:__ You want to get rid of the duplicate (or triplicate) commits
+in your git commit history.
+
+Before you begin [Update your package][mergeconflict] to the existing version on
+Bioconductor.
+
+
+#### Steps:
+
+1. **IMPORTANT** Make a backup of the branch with duplicate commits,
+   call this `master_backup` (or `RELEASE_3_7_backup`). The name of
+   the back up branch should be identifiable and specific to the
+   branch you are trying to fix (i.e if you want to fix the *master*
+   branch or some `<RELEASE_X_Y>` branch).
+
+   On master, (make sure you are on master by `git checkout master`)
+
+		git branch master_backup
+
+
+2. Identify the commit from which the duplicates have
+   originated. These commits are more often than not, `merge` commits.
+
+3. Reset your branch to the commit *before* the merge commit.
+
+		git reset —hard <commit_id>
+
+4. Now cherry pick your commits from the `master_backup` branch.
+
+		git cherry-pick <commit_id>
+
+	a. The commits you cherry-pick should be only 1 version of the
+    duplicate commit, i.e don’t cherry-pick the same commit twice.
+
+	b. Include the branching and version bump commits in your
+    cherry-pick. Make the package history look as normal as possible.
+
+5. (Optional) In some cases, there are conflicts you need to fix for
+   the cherry-pick to succeed. Please read the documentation on how
+   to [resolve conflicts][mergeconflict]
+
+6. Finally, you would need to contact the bioc-devel mailing list to
+   reach the Bioconductor core team to sync your repository with the
+   version on Bioconductor.  This is not possible as `--force` pushes
+   which alter the git timeline are not possible for maintainers.
+
+
+#### How to check if your package has duplicate commits
+
+One way is to check the log. You should see the same commit message
+with the same changes, but with a different commit ID, if you try
+
+	git log
+
+or
+
+	git log --oneline
+
+#### Script to detect duplicate commits
+
+Run this script written in python to [detect duplicate commits][]
+which are specific to Bioconductor repositories.
+
+Usage example:
+
+	python detect_duplicate_commits.py /BiocGenerics 1000
+
+	python detect_duplicate_commits.py <path_to_package> <number of commits to check>'
+

-# Robust and Efficient Code
-
-_R_ can be a robust, fast and efficient programming language, but some
-coding practices can be very unfortunate. Here are some suggestions.
-
-## Guiding Principles
-
-1. The primary principle is to make sure your code is **correct**. Use
-   `identical()` or `all.equal()` to ensure correctness, and
-   [unit tests][] to ensure consistent results across code revisions.
-
-2. Write robust code. Avoid efficiencies that do not easily handle
-   edge cases such as 0 length or `NA` values.
-
-3. Know when to stop trying to be efficient. If the code takes a
-   fraction of a second to evaluate, there is no sense in trying for
-   further improvement. Use `system.time()` or a package like
-   [microbenchmark][] to quantify performance gains.
-
-## Common Advice
-
-### Vectorize
-
-Vectorize, rather than iterate (`for` loops, `lapply()`, `apply()` are
-common iteration idioms in _R_). A single call `y <- sqrt(x)` with a
-vector `x` of length `n` is an example of a vectorized function. A
-call such as `y <- sapply(x, sqrt)` or a `for` loop `for (i in
-seq_along(x)) y[i] <- sqrt(x[i])` is an iterative version of the same
-call, and should be avoided. Often, iterative calculations that can be
-vectorized are ""hidden"" in the body of a `for` loop
-
-    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
-        ## ...
-        tmp <- foo(x[i])
-        y <- tmp + ## ...
-    }
-
-and can be 'hoisted' out of the loop
-
-    tmp <- foo(x)
-    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
-        ## ...
-        y <- tmp[i] + ##
-    }
-
-Often this principle can be applied repeatedly, and an iterative
-`for` loop becomes a few lines of vectorized function calls.
-
-### 'Pre-allocate and fill' if iterations are necessary
-
-Preallocate-and-fill (usually via `lapply()` or `vapply()`) rather
-than copy-and-append. If creating a vector or list of results, use
-`lapply()` (to create a list) or `vapply()` (to create a vector)
-rather than a `for` loop. For instance,
-
-    n <- 10000
-    x <- vapply(seq_len(n), function(i) {
-        ## ...
-    }, integer(1))
-
-manages the memory allocation of `x` and compactly represents the
-transformation being performed. A `for` loop might be appropriate if
-the iteration has side effects (e.g., displaying a plot) or where
-calculation of one value depends on a previous value. When creating a
-vector in a `for` loop, always pre-allocate the result
-
-    x <- integer(n)
-    if (n > 0) x[1] <- 0
-    for (i in seq_len(n - 1)) {
-        ## x[i + 1] <- ...
-    }
-
-**Never** adopt a strategy of 'copy-and-append'
-
-    not_this <- function(n) {
-        x <- integer()
-        for (i in seq_len(n))
-            x[i] = i
-        x
-    }
-
-This pattern copies the current value of `x` each time through the
-loop, making `n^2 / 2` total copies, and scale very poorly even for
-trivial computations:
-
-    > system.time(not_this(1000)
-       user  system elapsed
-      0.004   0.000   0.004
-    > system.time(not_this(10000))
-       user  system elapsed
-      0.169   0.000   0.168
-    > system.time(not_this(100000))
-       user  system elapsed
-     22.827   1.120  23.936
-
-### Avoid `1:n` style iterations
-
-Write `seq_len(n)` or `seq_along(x)` rather than `1:n` or
-`1:length(x)`. This protects against the case when `n` or `length(x)`
-is 0 (which often occurs as an unexpected 'edge case' in real code) or
-negative.
-
-### Re-use existing functionality
-
-For common input formats see [common _Bioconductor_ methods and classes][]
-
-If there are problems, e.g., in performance or parsing your particular
-file type, ask for input from other developers on the bioc-devel
-mailing list. Common disadvantages to 'implementing your own' are the
-introduction of non-standard data representations (e.g., neglecting to
-translate coordinate systems of file formats to Bioconductor objects)
-and user bewilderment.
-
-### Re-use existing classes
-
-Re-use enhances interoperability between _Bioconductor_ packages while
-providing robust code for data manipulation.
-
-Use `GenomicRanges::GRanges` (and `GRangesList`) to represent 1-based,
-closed-interval genomic coordinates.
-
-Use `SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment` (with or without
-ranges as row data) to coordinate rectangular feature x sample data
-(e.g., RNAseq count matrix) with feature and sample description. Use
-`SummarizedExperiment` rather than the older `ExpressionSet`,
-especially for sequence data.
-
-For more existing classes see [common _Bioconductor_ methods and classes][]
-
-### Essential S4 interface
-
-Remember to **re-use** [common _Bioconductor_ methods and classes][]
-before implementing new representations. This encourages
-interoperability and simplifies your own package development.
-
-If your data requires a new representation or function, carefully
-design an S4 class or generic so that other package developers with
-similar needs will be able to re-use your hard work, and so that users
-of related packages will be able to seamlessly use your data
-structures. Do not hesitate to ask on the Bioc-devel mailing list for
-advice.
-
-For any class you define, implement and use a 'constructor' for object
-creation. A constructor is usually plain-old-function (rather than,
-e.g., a generic with methods). It provides documented and
-user-friendly arguments, while allowing for developer-friendly
-implementation. Use the constructor throughout your own code,
-examples, and vignette.
-
-Implement a `show()` method to effectively convey information to your
-users without overwhelming them with detail.
-
-Accessors (simple functions that return components of your object)
-rather than direct slot access (using `@`) help to isolate the
-implementation of your class from its interface. Generally `@` should
-only be used in an accessor, all other code should use the
-accessor. The accessor does not need to be exported from the class if
-the user has no need or business accessing parts of your data
-object. Plain-old-functions (rather than generic + method) are often
-sufficient for accessors; it's often useful to employ (consistently) a
-lightweight name mangling scheme (e.g., starting the accessor method
-name with a 2 or 3 letter acronym for your package) to avoid name
-collisions between similarly named functions in other packages.
-
-The following layout is sometimes used to organize classes and
-methods; other approaches are possible and acceptable.
-
-* All class definitions in R/AllClasses.R
-* All generic function definitions in R/AllGenerics.R
-* Methods are defined in a file named by the generic function. For
-  example, all `show` methods would go in R/show-methods.R.
-
-A Collates: field in the DESCRIPTION file may be necessary to order
-class and method definitions appropriately during package
-installation.
-
-### Parallel Recommendations
-
-We recommend using [BiocParallel][]. It provides a consistent
-interface to the user and supports the major parallel computing
-styles: forks and processes on a single computer, ad hoc clusters,
-batch schedulers and cloud computing. By default, `BiocParallel`
-chooses a parallel back-end appropriate for the OS and is supported
-across Unix, Mac and Windows. Coding requirements for `BiocParallel`
-are:
-
-- Use `lapply()`-style iteration instead of explicit for loops.
-- The `FUN` argument to `bplapply()` must be a self-contained
-  function; all symbols used in the function are from default R
-  packages, from packages `require()`'ed in the function, or passed in
-  as arguments.
-- Allow the user to specify the BiocParallel back-end. Do this by
-  invoking `bplapply()` _without_ specifying `BPPARAM`; the user can
-  then override the default choice with `BiocParallel::register()`.
-
-For more information see the [BiocParallel vignette][].

+## R Code Best Practices and Guidelines
+
+Many common coding and sytax issues are flagged in `R CMD check` and
+`BiocCheck()` (see the `R CMD check`
+[cheatsheet](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html) and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""BiocCheck"", vignette = ""BiocCheck.html"")` vignette. Every
+effort should be made to clear up ERROR, WARNING, or Notes produced from these
+checks.
 
+### Code syntax and efficiency
 
-### End-User messages
+* Use `vapply()` instead of `sapply()`, and use the various `apply` functions instead of `for` loops. See below section on vectorize.
+* Use `seq_len()` or `seq_along()` instead of `1:...`. See below section on avoid `1:n` style iterations
+* Use `TRUE` and `FALSE` instead of `T` and `F`.
+* Use of numeric indices (rather than robust named indices).
+* Use `is()` instead of `class() ==` and `class() !=`.
+* Use `system2()` instead of `system()`.
+* Do not use `set.seed()` in any internal <i class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> code.
+* Do not use `browser()` in any internal <i class=""fab fa-r-project""></i> code.
+* Avoid the use of `<<-`.
+* Avoid use of direct slot access with `@` or `slot()`. Accessor methods should be created and utilized
+* Use the packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""ExperimentHub"")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""AnnotationHub"")` instead of downloading external data from unsanctioned providers such as <i class=""fab fa-github""></i> GitHub, <i * class=""fa fa-dropbox"" aria-hidden=""true""></i> Dropbox, etc. In general, data utlilzed in packages should be downloaded from trusted public databases. See also section on web querying and file caching.
+* Use `<-` instead of `=` for assigning variables except in function arguments.
+
+#### End-User messages
+
+Use the functions `message()`, `warning()` and `error()`, instead of the
+`cat()` function (except for customized `show()` methods). `paste0()` should
+generally not be used in these methods except for collapsing multiple values
+from a variable.
 
 * `message()` communicates diagnostic messages (e.g., progress during
   lengthy computations) during code evaluation.
 * `warning()` communicates unusual situations handled by your code.
 * `stop()` indicates an error condition.
-* `cat()` or `print()` are used only when displaying an object to the
-  user, e.g., in a `show` method.
+* `cat()` or `print()` are used only when displaying an object to the user in a `show` method.
+  
+#### Graphic Device
 
-### Misc
+Use `dev.new()` to start a graphics drive if necessary. Avoid using `x11()`
+or `X11()`, for it can only be called on machines that have access to an X
+server.
 
-* Use `<-` not `=` for assignment.
 
-#### Additonal references
+#### Web Querying and File caching
 
-* [Hadley Wickhams's R Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
+Files downloaded should be cached.
+Please use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg(""BiocFileCache"")`.
+If a maintainer creates their own caching directory, it should utilize standard
+caching directories `tools::R_user_dir(package, which=""cache"")`. It is not
+allowed to download or write any files to a users home directory, working
+directory, or installed package directory. Files should be cached as stated
+above with `BiocFileCache` (preferred) or `R_user_dir` or `tempdir()/tempfile()`
+if files should not be persistent.
 
-* [formatR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/formatR/index.html) a
-  package that assists with formatting.
+Please also follow guiding principles in Appendix section [Querying Web
+Resources](#querying-web-resources), if applicable.
+
+
+
+## Robust and Efficient R Code
+
+_R_ can be a robust, fast and efficient programming language, but some
+coding practices can be very unfortunate. Here are some suggestions.
+
+### Guiding Principles
+
+1. The primary principle is to make sure your code is **correct**. Use
+   `identical()` or `all.equal()` to ensure correctness, and
+   [unit tests][] to ensure consistent results across code revisions.
+
+2. Write robust code. Avoid efficiencies that do not easily handle
+   edge cases such as 0 length or `NA` values.
+
+3. Know when to stop trying to be efficient. If the code takes a
+   fraction of a second to evaluate, there is no sense in trying for
+   further improvement. Use `system.time()` or a package like
+   [microbenchmark][] to quantify performance gains.
+
+### Reuse Existing Functionality and Classes
+
+Emphasized again for good measure!  Reuse existing import/export methods,
+functionality, and classes whenever possible. 
+
+### Vectorize
+
+Many R operations are performed on the whole object, not just the elements of
+the object (e.g., `sum(x)` instead of `x[1] + x[2] + x[2] + ...`). In
+particular, relatively few situations require an explicit `for` loop.
 
+Vectorize, rather than iterate (`for` loops, `lapply()`, `apply()` are
+common iteration idioms in _R_). A single call `y <- sqrt(x)` with a
+vector `x` of length `n` is an example of a vectorized function. A
+call such as `y <- sapply(x, sqrt)` or a `for` loop `for (i in
+seq_along(x)) y[i] <- sqrt(x[i])` is an iterative version of the same
+call, and should be avoided. Often, iterative calculations that can be
+vectorized are ""hidden"" in the body of a `for` loop
+
+    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
+        ## ...
+        tmp <- foo(x[i])
+        y <- tmp + ## ...
+    }
+
+and can be 'hoisted' out of the loop
+
+    tmp <- foo(x)
+    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
+        ## ...
+        y <- tmp[i] + ##
+    }
+
+Often this principle can be applied repeatedly, and an iterative
+`for` loop becomes a few lines of vectorized function calls.
+
+### 'Pre-allocate and fill' if iterations are necessary
+
+Preallocate-and-fill (usually via `lapply()` or `vapply()`) rather
+than copy-and-append. If creating a vector or list of results, use
+`lapply()` (to create a list) or `vapply()` (to create a vector)
+rather than a `for` loop. For instance,
+
+    n <- 10000
+    x <- vapply(seq_len(n), function(i) {
+        ## ...
+    }, integer(1))
+
+manages the memory allocation of `x` and compactly represents the
+transformation being performed. A `for` loop might be appropriate if
+the iteration has side effects (e.g., displaying a plot) or where
+calculation of one value depends on a previous value. When creating a
+vector in a `for` loop, always pre-allocate the result
+
+    x <- integer(n)
+    if (n > 0) x[1] <- 0
+    for (i in seq_len(n - 1)) {
+        ## x[i + 1] <- ...
+    }
+
+**Never** adopt a strategy of 'copy-and-append'
+
+    not_this <- function(n) {
+        x <- integer()
+        for (i in seq_len(n))
+            x[i] = i
+        x
+    }
+
+This pattern copies the current value of `x` each time through the
+loop, making `n^2 / 2` total copies, and scale very poorly even for
+trivial computations:
+
+    > system.time(not_this(1000)
+       user  system elapsed
+      0.004   0.000   0.004
+    > system.time(not_this(10000))
+       user  system elapsed
+      0.169   0.000   0.168
+    > system.time(not_this(100000))
+       user  system elapsed
+     22.827   1.120  23.936
+
+### Avoid `1:n` style iterations
+
+Write `seq_len(n)` or `seq_along(x)` rather than `1:n` or
+`1:length(x)`. This protects against the case when `n` or `length(x)`
+is 0 (which often occurs as an unexpected 'edge case' in real code) or
+negative.
+
+
+### Parallel Recommendations
+
+We recommend using [BiocParallel][]. It provides a consistent
+interface to the user and supports the major parallel computing
+styles: forks and processes on a single computer, ad hoc clusters,
+batch schedulers and cloud computing. By default, `BiocParallel`
+chooses a parallel back-end appropriate for the OS and is supported
+across Unix, Mac and Windows. Coding requirements for `BiocParallel`
+are:
+
+- Use `lapply()`-style iteration instead of explicit for loops.
+- The `FUN` argument to `bplapply()` must be a self-contained
+  function; all symbols used in the function are from default R
+  packages, from packages `require()`'ed in the function, or passed in
+  as arguments.
+- Allow the user to specify the BiocParallel back-end. Do this by
+  invoking `bplapply()` _without_ specifying `BPPARAM`; the user can
+  then override the default choice with `BiocParallel::register()`.
+
+For more information see the [BiocParallel vignette][].
+
+When implementing in package development, a minimal number of cores (1 or 2)
+should be set as a default.

+Bioconductor Packages: Guidelines for Developers and Reviewers
+==============================================================
+
+[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) 
+[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kevinrue/bioc_package_guide/workflows/build_deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kevinrue/bioc_package_guide/actions)
+
+[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/)'s guide for package development, maintenance, and peer review.
+[Read it here](https://kevinrue.github.io/bioc_package_guide).
+
+## Contributing
+
+### Suggestions and updates
+
+This book contains our guidelines for packages contributed to the [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) suite of packages.
+These guidelines are always a work in progress - corrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issue submissions in this repository](https://github.com/kevinrue/bioc_package_guide/issues/new).
+Open discussions are welcome in our [Slack](https://bioc-community.herokuapp.com/).
+You can also suggest changes by editing the `.Rmd` files that are at the root of this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/kevinrue/bioc_package_guide/pulls).
+An ""Edit this page"" link in the side bar on the right of each book chapter will take you directly to the relevant page on the GitHub repository to make such changes.
+Please target your pull requests to the `master` branch.
+
+### Technical details
+
+Deployment is done via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kevinrue/bioc_package_guide/actions):
+
+* whenever there's a push to `master`, the book is built and its content is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
+
+To preview the book locally - preferably before opening a pull request and while reviewing it - use the following code in an R console with the working directory set to the root of this repository, making sure that all the dependencies of the book are available (see file `DESCRIPTION`).
+
+```r
+bookdown::render_book()
+```
+
+We recommend using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to restore the package environment for this project from the `renv.lock` file in this repository, using the the following command:
+
+```r
+renv::restore()
+```
